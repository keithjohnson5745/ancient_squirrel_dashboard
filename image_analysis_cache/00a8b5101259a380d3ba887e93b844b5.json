The alert colors and direct language match the educational, warning style suggested by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no major mismatch; the visual (hand gesture and bold text) closely matches the idea of 'watching for signs,' though the thumbnail does not explicitly reference relationships or respect\u2014these specifics are only provided by the video\u2019s title, not the visuals."
