  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly supports the title by highlighting the themes of 'truth,' 'sex,' and 'intimacy' with oversized, prominent text, bold color contrasts, and facial expressions that suggest emotional candor and conversation. The inclusion of both interviewer and expert visually implies a revealing interview or discussion format.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatch. The thumbnail is more sensationalist and bold in language ('THE TRUTH'), which is a classic clickbait translation of the more nuanced title. The title specifies Esther Perel and frames the topic as advice, while the thumbnail's text uses broader, more dramatic language to maximize clicks."
