  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Provocative, slightly unsettling, curious. The clean scientific layout contrasts with the visceral reaction many viewers have to bugs and spiders.",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "The white background and sterile aesthetic evoke a 'specimen' or 'lab' theme, implying expertise and method.",
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Shock value through unusual/creepy imagery (giant insects and spider)",
      "Clear labeling for instant recognition",
      "Suggesting a challenge or taboo topic (eating insects)"

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image provides literal visual representations of multiple insects mentioned in the title. The direct, scientific-style presentation supports the 'Method Mastery' aspect, emphasizing specialized knowledge. The variety shows the 'every insect' claim literally.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no obvious mismatch; however, some may note that a tarantula is an arachnid, not an insect, which is a minor scientific inaccuracy."
