  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title by explicitly raising the question about male size, using a provocative question, metaphorical imagery (cucumber being measured), and featuring a medical expert. The text in both English and Hindi covers the linguistic breadth of the audience, closely matching the video title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There are no significant mismatches. Both title and thumbnail focus on male size anxiety and the 'truth' about averages, though the thumbnail perhaps pushes slightly more emotional urgency with its direct question compared to the more factual tone implied in the title."
