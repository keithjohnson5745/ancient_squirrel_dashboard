  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses both text and visuals to tease the video's subject matter, with the Hindi caption closely echoing the video title. The banana in hand (with an added animal head for humor/shock value) visually represents the concept of \u2018growth\u2019 and \u2018enjoyment\u2019 from using hands, tying directly to both the literal and figurative meanings in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a synergy between the provocative, clickbaity wording of the title and the suggestive, humorous imagery in the thumbnail. The surreal addition of the duck\u2019s head to the banana adds absurdity, which may contrast with any serious undertone but primarily serves to escalate curiosity and amusement."
