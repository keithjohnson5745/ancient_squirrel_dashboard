  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail depicts two women (potentially family/friends) in a baby store with shocked faces, surrounded by expensive baby products and shopping carts, visually representing the act of 'spoiling' an expectant mother or baby for a day \u2013 as suggested by the title. The prominent large spending amount (\u20b1200K+) and baby-centric props directly reinforce the video's theme of indulgence/shopping for a pregnant individual.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Title says 'Spoiling Buntis' ('buntis' means pregnant woman in Filipino), but text in the thumbnail says 'Spoiling Baby Thirdy' and 'Tita's Duty', slightly shifting focus to the baby and the 'tita' (aunt) rather than the pregnant woman herself. However, the visual language and context are still closely related."
