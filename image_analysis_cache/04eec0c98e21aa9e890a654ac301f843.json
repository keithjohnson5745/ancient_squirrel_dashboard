  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a peaceful, sleeping baby directly illustrates the desired result mentioned in the title\u2014success in pregnancy. The use of 'DUA' and 'BEST DUA' in large, prominent text makes it clear the video is about a spiritual or religious solution for pregnancy. The nurturing colors and props further connect emotionally to viewers seeking parenthood.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatch. The thumbnail\u2019s focus on the baby is a literal representation of the goal described in the title. The only minor disconnect may be that the thumbnail centers on the outcome (a healthy baby) rather than the process (pregnancy itself), but this is a common and effective clickbait technique. The reciter\u2019s name in the thumbnail matches the religious context suggested by 'Dua'."
