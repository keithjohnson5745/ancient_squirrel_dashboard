  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the video's promise by using the phrase 'Women need to eat this!' which mirrors the video title's focus on specific foods to eat for health during menopause. The authoritative, assertive portrait of a female expert visually aligns with a doctor's recommendations.",
    "contrasts_or_mismatches": "Slightly different wording: the thumbnail speaks generally ('Women need to eat this!'), while the title is specific to menopause, weight gain, and hormones. The thumbnail does not visually show food or menopause-related imagery, but instead relies on text and facial expression to drive urgency."
