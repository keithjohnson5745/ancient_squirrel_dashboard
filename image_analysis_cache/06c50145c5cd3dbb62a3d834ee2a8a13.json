      "Blue": "approx. 60% (background and one wire)",
      "Red": "approx. 15% (wave/wire)",
      "Yellow": "approx. 10% (wave/wire)",
      "Light Blue": "approx. 10% (wave/wire, slightly different from the background blue)",
      "White": "approx. 3% (text)",
      "Brown/Wood": "approx. 2% (bottom border)",
      "Purple (electric spark)": "approx. <1% (electric effect at left edge)"
    },
    "Composition type": "Wide shot with diagrammatic, non-human elements",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 0,
      "Expressions": "N/A",
      "Demographics": "N/A"
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "Three sinusoidal waveform-shaped colored wires (red, yellow, blue)",
      "Numerals 1, 2, and 3 placed over each corresponding wire",
      "Electric spark/arc effect at the end of one wire"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Solid blue background with a strip of wooden surface at the bottom, contextually suggestive of a classroom or demonstrative setting"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible in the thumbnail": [
      "WHY NOT MORE PHASES?",
      "1",
      "2",
      "3"
    ],
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, sans-serif, block letters for main text",
      "Emphasis": "Strong emphasis (all-caps), with drop shadow effect for contrast",
      "Color": {
        "Main text": "White",
        "Numeral 1": "Red",
        "Numeral 2": "Yellow",
        "Numeral 3": "Light blue"
      }
    },
    "Text placement within frame": {
      "Main text": "Top half, left-aligned and spanning width",
      "Numerals": "Superimposed directly above or on the corresponding colored waveforms near wire entry points"
    },
    "Use of emotional/trigger words": [
      "WHY NOT",
      "MORE"
    ]
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Curious, slightly provocative\u2014inviting the viewer to question a standard concept",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [
      "Sine wave wires representing electrical phases",
      "Electric arc suggesting real electrical energy"
    ],
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Question format creates intrigue and invites viewers to seek an answer",
      "Bold, large text clearly communicates the video's main question",
      "Visual emphasis on the number of phases stirs curiosity"
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit logos, though the clean style and didactic layout may suggest a consistent educational YouTube channel identity"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the concept of three-phase power using color-coded waveforms/wires labeled 1, 2, and 3, matching the educational theme hinted at in the video title ('How 3 Phase Power works: why 3 phases?'). The text in the thumbnail ('WHY NOT MORE PHASES?') visually and conceptually links to the 'why 3 phases?' portion of the title by expanding the question.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Slight difference in question focus\u2014the title asks 'why 3 phases?', while the thumbnail questions 'why not more?', but both serve as complementary prompts that arouse curiosity about the logic behind three phases specifically."
