The group setting and expressions match the comedic/friendly vibe indicated by the hashtags (#funny #comedy).",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There are no obvious mismatches; however, the innuendo in the title ('maze liye') may be stronger than what is visually shown in the thumbnail, which remains friendly but unprovocative. The thumbnail is more wholesome and conversational compared to the playful/suggestive tone of the title."
