  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail clearly shows well-known lubricant products (WD-40, Blaster) and a device that implies there is a demonstration or test occurring. This visual supports the title's promise of evaluating the 'best multiuse lubricant.'",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "No major mismatch; however, the lack of explicit text or numerical comparison (e.g., '1 vs 2') weakens immediate visual clarity for some viewers about a head-to-head test."
