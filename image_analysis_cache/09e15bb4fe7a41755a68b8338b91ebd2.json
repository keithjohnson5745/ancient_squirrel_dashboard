  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually communicates survival through hardship: the man\u2019s serious expression aligns with the themes of extreme adversity ('10 years in prison', battling malaria, eating ants) described in the title. The bold, urgent text heightens the sense of dramatic storytelling.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail focuses specifically on the imprisonment aspect and does not visually reference malaria or the act of eating ants mentioned in the title. There is a slight mismatch since the thumbnail omits imagery related to illness or survival acts (such as ants), possibly narrowing the story\u2019s scope to just the imprisonment."
