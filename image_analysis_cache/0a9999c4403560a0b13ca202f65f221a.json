  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly addresses the topic of the title (\u2018Premature Ejaculation\u2019) by using a couple who look distressed in bed and a medical/expert figure with a shocked face. The emotional expressions and question in the text mirror the video\u2019s promise of uncovering an underlying truth most men don\u2019t know.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no explicit use of the term \u2018premature ejaculation\u2019 in the thumbnail, which keeps it YouTube-friendly but slightly less direct than the title. The use of symbols, text, and expressions makes the topic clear without stating it outright."
