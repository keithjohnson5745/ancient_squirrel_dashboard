    ],

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a young man in a reflective pose (hand-on-chest) directly aligns with the concept of a 'reflection video'. The inclusion of \"MODULE 10\" connects the video to specific academic content, consistent with the title referencing multiple modules.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title references 'MODULE 9-11', but the thumbnail text only mentions 'MODULE 10', which could cause minor confusion about the exact scope of the video. Otherwise, the tone and subject matter appear well-matched."
