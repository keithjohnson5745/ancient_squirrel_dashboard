    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly shows a screen capture from the ImageJ (Fiji) software with segmented and numbered particles on an SEM image, clearly illustrating the process promised in the title: 'Using ImageJ (FiJi) to measure particles on SEM images.' The visual matches the technical focus of the video.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no significant contrast or mismatch. Both thumbnail and title are consistent, informative, and focused on demonstrating the software workflow for particle measurement in SEM imagery."
