  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by depicting a stereotypical engineer character, suggesting professionalism, staring intensely at a ridiculous/impossible quiz question. The laser eyes add a humorous exaggeration to the competitive premise implied in the title ('Can a Professional Engineer beat the IMPOSSIBLE quiz?'). The quiz interface and answers make clear reference to an 'impossible' or nonsensical challenge.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant contrasts. Both the thumbnail and title are playful and hyperbolic, emphasizing the 'impossibility' of the quiz and the challenge faced by a professional engineer. Both effectively communicate humor and challenge."
