  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the video title ('Menopause and Orgasms') by featuring the word 'Menopause' prominently and asking a direct question about orgasm. The presence of a medical professional and the phrase 'real facts' adds authority, signaling a credible discussion about the subject.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "There is a strong alignment overall. However, the visual tone is formal and clinical rather than provocative, which might downplay the potentially sensational or emotional nature implied by the topic. There is no explicit visual metaphor for orgasms, which keeps the image appropriate for a broad audience."
