      "White/Beige (resistors)": "25%",
      "Black (text/striped markings)": "15%",
      "Red/Brown/Gold accents (resistor bands, props)": "5%",
      "Yellow (border)": "5%"
    },
    "Composition type": "Medium close-up shot, focusing on a variety of resistors displayed horizontally across the bottom half of the image.",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 0,
      "Expressions": "N/A",
      "Demographics": "N/A"
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "Several types of electronic resistors (carbon film, metal film, surface-mount, thermistor, variable/light-dependent resistor)."
    ],
    "Background environment": "Solid blue graph-paper style background bordered in yellow, giving a technical/educational feel."
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible": "RESISTORS EXPLAINED",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, sans-serif, all uppercase, modern/clean.",
      "Emphasis": "Very high (thick font, strong contrast, white text on black background bar).",
      "Color": "White text with black background rectangle."
    },
    "Text placement within frame": "Top left quadrant, stacked in two lines, positioned prominently over the less visually busy part of the background.",
    "Use of emotional/trigger words": [
      "EXPLAINED"
    ]
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Educational, authoritative, and approachable. The color scheme is energetic and inviting yet serious.",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "The variety of resistor types functions as symbols for the video\u2019s depth and educational rigor. The graph paper background metaphorically evokes 'blueprint' or 'engineering' knowledge.",
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Bold, direct language that promises clear information.",
      "Large, easy-to-read text.",
      "Bright edges and high contrast to catch the eye."
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit branding (logo, channel name), but style suggests educational/DIY electronics."
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The array of resistors directly addresses the topic of 'How Resistors Work' and the 'Resistors Explained' text provides a straightforward promise of demystification, matching the 'Unravel the Mysteries' phrasing from the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is very literal and straightforward, prioritizing clarity over mystery, whereas the title promises some intrigue ('Unravel the Mysteries'). However, the idea of clarity/education is consistent across both."
