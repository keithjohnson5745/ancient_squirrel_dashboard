  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Both the thumbnail and title use language urging men not to do certain things: 'NEVER DO THIS!' in the thumbnail visually matches '9 Things Smart Men Should NOT Do With Women' in the title. The image of the confident, approachable woman suggests expertise about behavior around women, supporting the subject matter. The number of things ('9') is referenced in both.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail doesn't explicitly show 'with women' visually, though the woman in the image hints at the dating/relationship context. The main emphasis is on prohibition and advice, consistent with the title. The playful cat may be extraneous to the main topic."
