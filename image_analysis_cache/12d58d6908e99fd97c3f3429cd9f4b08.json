  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly presents the key symptom from the title ('Difficulty Swallowing') using large text, and the presence of an older man with a serious expression visually matches the typical clinical scenario discussed in an OSCE/preparation guide. The text 'HISTORY' ties in with the idea of clinical history taking.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Most secondary details from the title ('Weight Loss', 'OSCE Guide', 'UKMLA', 'CPSA', 'PLAB 2') are absent from the thumbnail, which focuses solely on 'Difficulty Swallowing History'. The focus is on the clinical symptom rather than the exam-preparation angle."
