  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text is more sensational ('STOP' and 'ENLARGEMENT?!') and dramatic than the measured, explanatory tone of the title, which mentions 'Best Ways' and 'Explained by a Urologist'. The thumbnail aims to grab attention while the title promises practical, professional advice."
