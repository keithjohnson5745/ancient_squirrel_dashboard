  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a pregnant belly and nurturing hands is a direct visual reference to both 'fertility' and 'pregnancy' in the title. The sparkles and dramatic lighting evoke healing, manifestation, and mystical qualities, mirroring the concepts of 'healing,' 'manifestation,' and 'frequencies' declared in the title. Bold text echoes the action-oriented language from the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is clear reinforcement\u2014no significant contrast or mismatch. The thumbnail delivers an immediate, visually explicit version of the video's offer ('manifesting' pregnancy), while the title adds detail about the method (music, frequencies, subliminal). The only slight gap is the absence of musical or frequency iconography in the thumbnail, though the mystical sparkles may be intended to symbolically fill this role."
