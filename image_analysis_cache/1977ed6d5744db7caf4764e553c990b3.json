  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly reinforces the video title: it shows someone actually making (mixing or preparing) a liquid in a small bottle, visually supporting the idea of 'DIY natural lube.'

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail does not show any flavoring elements or clearly reference 'date night' or 'flavored' directly. It remains somewhat clinical and clean rather than playful/romantic, except for the color/word cues."
