      "Style": "Bold, block sans-serif (for main text), serif (for Carl Jung name)",
      "Emphasis": "Mix of colors and weights. 'You are VERY' uses yellow/red for emphasis. 'ATTRACTIVE' is large and white for strong impact.",
      "Color": "White, yellow, and red for different words.",
      "Font sizes": "Largest for 'ATTRACTIVE', medium for rest. 'CARL JUNG' is small and subtle."

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail text directly supports the title's promise of uncovering signs of attractiveness, using large, emphasized text to grab attention.

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no strong visual indication of '12 signs' specifically in the thumbnail (the number 12 is not present), nor is there a direct depiction of attractiveness besides the assertion in text. The thumbnail universalizes the message instead of hinting at a list or specifics."
