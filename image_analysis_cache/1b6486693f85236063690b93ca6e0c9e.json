(Learn today!) is mirrored in the explicit promise of explanation and demonstration in the thumbnail texts ('WITH DEMO'). The invitation to learn, combined with visual cues and professional authority, provides cohesion between the title and thumbnail.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is quite direct and visually provocative using Western/English words and imagery, while the title is in Hindi and generic. The thumbnail\u2019s explicit content is much more attention-grabbing and specific compared to the fairly neutral and broad title."
