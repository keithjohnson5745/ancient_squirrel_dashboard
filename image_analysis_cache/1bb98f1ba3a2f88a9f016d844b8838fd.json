  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail gives a scientific and anatomical view of the pectoral muscles, directly referencing the 'Science' and 'Anatomy' aspects in the title. The presence of dumbbells relates to the 'Best Exercises' part, and the text 'Building the Chest' aligns with both the title and content.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no major mismatches. The scientific dissection is quite literal to the 'Anatomy' and 'Science' focus, while the dumbbells add the fitness/exercise angle. The title is broader ('Pecs') and thumbnail says 'Chest', but these are commonly interchangeable terms."
