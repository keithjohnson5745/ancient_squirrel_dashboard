  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail text directly echoes and amplifies the video's title message. The serious pose and styling of Jordan Peterson visually reinforce the idea of authority and gravity, matching the cautionary nature of the title ('If A Woman TELLS You These 5 Things, WALK AWAY FROM HER!'). The use of all caps, green for emphasis, and the urgent phrasing visually support the video\u2019s promise of important advice.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The main mismatch is specificity: the title references '5 things', whereas the thumbnail is less specific ('IF SHE SAYS THIS!'). The thumbnail makes the advice sound universal and more urgent, while the title suggests a list, which is not visually indicated. The thumbnail could arguably exaggerate the urgency compared to the list-style title."
