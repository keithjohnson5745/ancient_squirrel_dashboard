    "Composition type": "Medium close-up; the subject dominates the frame, cramped between sink, mirror, and shower.",
    "Human presence": {
      "number": 1,
      "expression": "Concerned, possibly overwhelmed or anxious (wide eyes, open mouth while brushing teeth).",
      "demographics": "Young girl, likely pre-teen or teenage, light skin and long straight hair"

    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "Shower head",

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the concept of someone (the daughter) attempting to survive in an impossibly tiny house, as presented by her awkward, cramped position in the miniature bathroom.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The title uses the superlative 'WORLD'S TINIEST HOUSE', but the thumbnail only shows a bathroom portion, not an entire house. The word 'survives' is not explicitly visualized, but the girl's stressed expression suggests a struggle, implicitly supporting the idea."
