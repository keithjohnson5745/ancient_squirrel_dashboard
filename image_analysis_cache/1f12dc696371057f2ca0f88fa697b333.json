  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly echoes the main promise of the title ('3 SECRETS to get pregnant'), featuring those exact keywords in bold, large text. The addition of the shushing emoji emphasizes the secretive aspect, paralleling the 'secrets' mentioned in the title. The presence of a professional-appearing individual strengthens credibility, aligning with the advice/educational nature implied in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail omits the phrase 'even if you have LOW EGG QUALITY,' which is included in the video title. This exclusion keeps the focus broader and more universally appealing, potentially omitting a detail that makes the video even more niche. This is a typical clickbait strategy to attract a larger audience before narrowing the focus in the video itself."
