  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The close-up portrait on the thumbnail directly relates to the 'Portrait Video' aspect in the title.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail provides only part of a phrase ('An Eye for a'), while the title is more straightforward and full. There is no explicit reference to 'Nanny' or 'Canon' in the image content. The subject\u2019s identity relies on recognition rather than clear labelling."
