  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly references the subject of cleanliness with bold text ('You are dirty.'), tying into the video's provocative title about never being clean. The addition of 'It's normal and ok!' aligns visually and thematically with the message to stop worrying or causing harm, as referenced in the title.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "While both thumbnail and title open with provocative negativity, the thumbnail softens its tone visually with hearts, friendly colors, and a reassuring message, whereas the title leans more on shock value and threat ('NEVER', 'STOP hurting your anus!'). The thumbnail is less explicit about the anatomical reference, opting for a less direct, more approachable presentation."
