  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly references the video's topic\u2014'cervical mucus'\u2014in the large, clear text, ensuring the viewer immediately recognizes the subject. The woman's expression highlights the potentially awkward or difficult nature of the topic, matching the candid educational approach implied by the title ('How to get more fertile cervical mucus').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no significant mismatch. However, the title emphasizes 'more fertile' cervical mucus (implying a focus on fertility), while the thumbnail says only 'Improve Cervical Mucus,' which is somewhat broader but still relevant. The subtitle could be more explicit about 'fertility,' but the match is close."
