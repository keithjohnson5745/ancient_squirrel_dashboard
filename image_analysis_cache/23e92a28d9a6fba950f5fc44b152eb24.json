  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail juxtaposes an athletic stretch (visualizing 'stretching') with a real human brain (visualizing 'how stretching affects the brain'), directly illustrating the link promised in the title. The bold text 'Changing the Brain Through Stretching' matches and amplifies the title's focus on mechanism.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No substantive mismatch; both focus on the joint concepts of stretching and neurological change. The thumbnail may oversimplify the science with a direct visual metaphor, but it aligns effectively with the title\u2019s promise of revealing how stretching 'really works'."
