    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Both the thumbnail and title are direct, but the presence of an attractive woman may verge on sensationalism/clickbait, as her relevance to the actual medical content is unclear. Otherwise, the alignment is strong: the thumbnail and title are both explicit about solutions for erectile dysfunction."
