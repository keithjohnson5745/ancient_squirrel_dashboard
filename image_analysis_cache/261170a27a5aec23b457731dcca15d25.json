  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the practical, instructional nature promised by the title. It shows a demonstrative setup for condom application, explicitly labeled with do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to match \u2018How to put on a condom.\u2019 Visuals signal educational content (medical scrubs, step-by-step props), and the 60-second summary aspect is reflected in the clarity and immediacy of the layout.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches. Both thumbnail and title are highly congruent: visually clear, direct, and focused on the specific skill outlined. The \u2018OSCE | PLAB 2\u2019 medical exam context in the title is only very subtly referenced visually (scrubs, clinical setup), which could be more prominent for exam-takers, but the main teaching point is clearly represented."
