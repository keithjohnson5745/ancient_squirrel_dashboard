    "Contrasts or mismatches": "While the title specifies 'sperm quality', the thumbnail features a woman and uses broader terms ('male fertility'). Some may expect to see male subjects due to the topic. The overall tone (female educator, nurturing colors) suggests a supportive, informative approach, possibly appealing to couples or partners rather than strictly men."
