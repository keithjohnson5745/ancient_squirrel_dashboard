  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a child playing with blocks under the watchful presence of an adult visually represents the topic of developmental psychology, specifically early childhood. This aligns well with a video introducing Piaget\u2019s stages of cognitive development, which center on how children learn and develop.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No strong mismatches. The only potential shortcoming is the absence of any explicit educational cues (e.g., textbooks, chalkboards, or Piaget's name in text form), or symbolic references to the theory itself\u2014the thumbnail relies on context and implied association rather than overt labeling."
