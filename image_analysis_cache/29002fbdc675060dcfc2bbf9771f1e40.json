  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The center image of an intimate couple directly reinforces the topics of 'Tantric Sex' and physical intimacy, while the presence of two serious, professional speakers on either side represents the 'Monk & Harvard Psychiatrist' referenced in the title. The formal podcast/interview setting aligns with the idea of expert explanation.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is some visual contrast between the sexual, emotional imagery of the couple (central focus) and the reserved, professional demeanor of the speakers. This contrast may be deliberate to emphasize the unexpectedness of the topic being discussed by such experts, but could also come across as clickbait by promising a sensational topic in an otherwise formal context."
