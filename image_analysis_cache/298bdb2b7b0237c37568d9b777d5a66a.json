  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The presence of FOX News branding and a serious host visually supports the title's allegation of a 'despicable' CNN interview by positioning FOX as a counterpoint.

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail does not directly reference CNN or show footage/clips from the alleged interview; thus, it relies on association and implication rather than direct illustration. The masked figure might not be directly relevant to the title if viewers expect footage of the CNN interview or Karoline Leavitt with CNN."
