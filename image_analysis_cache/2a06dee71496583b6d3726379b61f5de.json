  "VISUAL ELEMENTS": {
    "Dominant colors": {
      "Black": "approx. 50% (shirt, background shadows)",
      "Beige/Light brown": "approx. 15% (skin tones, shelves in background)",
      "Blue": "approx. 10% (globe, some book spines)",
      "Red": "approx. 5% (graphic on shirt, books)",
      "White": "approx. 10% (shirt graphic, some background items)",
      "Other": "approx. 10% (purples, browns in the environment)"
    },
    "Composition type": "Medium shot (waist-up view of subject, some surrounding environment visible)",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expressions": "Serious, intent expression; appears to be speaking, possibly to an audience",
      "Demographics": "Adult male, light-medium skin tone, facial hair (goatee/mustache), short hair"
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "Person (likely Philip Zimbardo, per title/context)",
      "Black T-shirt with an abstract white/red graphic on the chest",
      "Bookshelf with books",
      "Globe",
      "Unclear object in top left (possibly a microscope or camera)"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Indoor, academic setting (bookshelf, globe, possibly a lecture or talk environment)"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "None (apart from possible graphics on the T-shirt, which is abstract and not readable as text)",
    "Font characteristics": "Not applicable (no visible text)",
    "Text placement within frame": "Not applicable",
    "Use of emotional/trigger words": "Not applicable"
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Serious, intellectual, slightly intense (from speaker's expression and body language)",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [
      "T-shirt graphic may symbolize wings, angels/demons, or a Rorschach inkblot (psychological association, relevant to the topic of 'evil')",
      "Scholarly props (books, globe) emphasize authority, academic credibility"
    ],
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Presenter's expressive, slightly intense pose can attract curiosity",
      "Unusual/ambiguous shirt graphic creates intrigue"
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit branding; background and pose resemble a TED Talk or academic lecture"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Focus on a single academic figure (Zimbardo) in a lecture setting visually supports the scholarly approach to exploring 'the psychology of evil.' The ambiguous, possibly symbolic shirt graphic hints at psychological themes (inkblot, duality of good/evil), aligning with the video\u2019s subject.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No obvious mismatch. However, the 'evil' theme is only subtly visually referenced (through the graphic and serious tone) rather than overtly depicted, which may rely heavily on pre-existing knowledge of Zimbardo\u2019s work or the video description."
