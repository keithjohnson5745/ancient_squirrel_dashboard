  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually amplifies the urgent message in the title by using the words 'SAFETY RECALL' and showing a close-up of someone who appears to be an expert. The giant engine graphic and arrow directly hint at the 'catastrophic engine failure' mentioned in the title. The use of yellow, red, and bold fonts invokes a sense of emergency consistent with 'recall' and 'catastrophic failure.'",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is close alignment between the thumbnail and the title. The only minor contrast is that the thumbnail only references 'GM 6.2,' narrowing focus to a specific engine, while the title more broadly refers to 'Nearly 1M Vehicles.'"
