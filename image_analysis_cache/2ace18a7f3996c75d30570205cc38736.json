  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The mask visually embodies the concept of 'masking' (hiding traits), directly aligning with the video's focus on 'high-masking' in women. The presence of a woman half-hidden by a mask literally represents the idea of autism being concealed. The clear, direct text explicitly introduces the target group (\u201cAUTISTIC WOMEN\u201d), matching the title\u2019s intent.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no evident mismatches; the design is very cohesive. The only minor difference is that the title refers to both 'women and girls,' while only an adult woman is shown (no younger girls), and the male-presenting individual is featured as a kind of 'guide' or presenter rather than as part of the target group."
