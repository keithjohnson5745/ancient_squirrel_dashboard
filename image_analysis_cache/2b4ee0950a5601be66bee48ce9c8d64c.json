    "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
      "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail shows an expert (historian-like figure) directly addressing a specific Cold War-related question pulled from social media, visually matching the title's promise of a historian answering questions. The tweet format matches the 'Tech Support' (Q&A) concept.",
      "Contrasts or mismatches": "No meaningful elements clash; the image delivers on the informative/expert dynamic set up by the title. If anything, the JFK example narrows the focus more tightly than the broader 'Cold War Questions' of the title, but this still serves as a compelling entry point."
