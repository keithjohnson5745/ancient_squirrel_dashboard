        "Indifference (neutral face on the rightmost figure)"

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The array of stick figures with shocked/confused expressions visually reinforces the idea of disbelief in accepted knowledge. The caveman and objects (bone, cube) hint at commonly misunderstood concepts. The overstated facial expressions directly relate to the word 'Totally Wrong' in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatch; both thumbnail and title support the theme of popular misconceptions. The cartoonish tone might downplay the seriousness, indicating an educational-entertainment (edutainment) approach rather than strictly academic rigor."
