  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly showcases lubricant products, tying in with the video's promise to inform the viewer about lubricants.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not depict a doctor or an expert, despite the title mentioning 'Hear From A Doctor.' The focus is entirely on the product and curiosity-triggering facts rather than featuring a medical professional."
