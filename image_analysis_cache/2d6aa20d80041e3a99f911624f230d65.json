  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title by showing a character about to ignore a clear warning sign ('DON'T EVEN TRY'). This directly ties to the video\u2019s theme of testing boundaries or doing unexpected things in a game that developers did not anticipate.",
