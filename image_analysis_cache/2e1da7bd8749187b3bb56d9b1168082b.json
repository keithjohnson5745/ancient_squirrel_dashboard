  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually embodies the core questions from the title. The left image symbolizes the shadowy, anonymous nature of call center scammers, underscoring secrecy/criminal intent, while the right side shows an actual call center (the operational aspect), illustrating 'how' the crime happens. The arrow and 'FAKE AMAZON SCRIPT' give a direct clue to the specific scam type, matching the title's promise to explain.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "There is no significant mismatch; the thumbnail is cohesive and directly relevant to the title. It delivers on both the crime ('SCAMS', 'CRIME') and the behind-the-scenes process ('How Crime Works', exposed with the call center photo). The contrast between anonymous criminal and real-world workplace also serves as a creative visual metaphor for the hidden crime within normal-looking business settings."
