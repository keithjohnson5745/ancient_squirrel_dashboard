  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The bold question in the thumbnail is directly related to the video's topic ('Why Penile Implants ARE Safe and Effective'), as it hints at the underlying theme of penis enlargement or modification.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses a deliberately provocative, open-ended question, which is less clinical than the assured, informative tone of the title. The thumbnail is designed to spark curiosity and attract clicks, whereas the title frames the content as authoritative and safe."
