  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a dramatic encounter between an imprisoned man and a dog in the presence of police, directly referencing the 'last wish before execution to see his dog.'

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "While the title suggests an emotional or possibly heartwarming reunion, the visual tone of the thumbnail is much more suspenseful and aggressive, with both the man and the dog appearing distressed rather than joyful, which may mislead viewers expecting a sentimental moment."
