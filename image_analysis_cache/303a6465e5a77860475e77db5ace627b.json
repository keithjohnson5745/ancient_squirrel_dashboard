The product is visibly displayed, the subject is clearly pregnant, text reiterates the 'get pregnant' theme, and the water droplet icon connects to both the product (a fertility lubricant) and to common visual shorthand for conception. The reassuring, hopeful expression of the subject creates emotional engagement aligned with the 'TTC tips' aspect in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no significant mismatches. The thumbnail and title are highly aligned. One minor difference is the thumbnail uses 'GET PREGNANT WITH PRESEED' while the full title clarifies this is a 'tutorial & TTC tips'\u2014the educational/tutorial aspect is not visually communicated in the thumbnail."
