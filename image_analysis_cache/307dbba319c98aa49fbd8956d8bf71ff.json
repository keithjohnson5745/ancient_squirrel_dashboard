  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Depicts cardinals in ritualistic activity at a table, wearing formal religious attire, visually connecting to the theme of preparatory actions before a conclave.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong alignment \u2014 the thumbnail straightforwardly illustrates the subject of the title. The one limitation is that the image only shows one type of activity (writing on paper), whereas the title suggests a broader list of rituals or tasks."
