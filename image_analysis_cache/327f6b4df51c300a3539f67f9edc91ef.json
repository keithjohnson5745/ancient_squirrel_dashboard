  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title with a group of dancers in eye-catching LED suits, suggesting a playful battle or contest to determine 'Who BEST DANCER?'. The high-energy imagery, with dancers mid-move, matches the fun and trendy dance themes referenced in the title (Coffin Dance, Shuffle, 2024). The TikTok logo connects to the viral dance trends the title invokes.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a minor contrast in that the thumbnail itself does not feature a literal coffin or funerary symbolism as in the original 'Coffin Dance' meme, relying instead on the dance motif and LED spectacle. However, the energetic night setting and costumed group effectively channel the viral, competitive, and celebratory spirit referenced in the title."
