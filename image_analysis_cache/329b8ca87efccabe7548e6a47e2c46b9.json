  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The scientist figure interacting with the clock's hands is a direct visual metaphor for the title's inquiry into whether science can influence/reverse ageing, representing the idea of humans (science) attempting to control or alter time/ageing.",
