  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly references the core assertion of the title\u2014questioning KY Jelly's suitability for couples trying to conceive.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is not overtly sensational but very direct. Both the title and image focus on discouraging the use of KY Jelly, but while the title hints at a deeper explanation ('The Truth About...'), the thumbnail offers a blunt directive with little nuance. No significant mismatches detected\u2014the message is cohesive and clear, if a bit blunt."
