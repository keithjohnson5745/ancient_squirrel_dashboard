  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail provides a concrete example of one pregnancy mistake alluded to in the title by showing a pregnant woman sitting in a way the text directly warns against. The arrow and instructive text ('DON'T SIT LIKE THIS') clarify that the video will address specific actions to avoid, linking directly to the concept of 'common pregnancy mistakes'.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail focuses visually on just one mistake (incorrect sitting posture), while the title promises a list (7 mistakes) that relate to postnatal complications. The thumbnail does not visually reference postnatal complications directly, so the connection relies on the viewer reading the title for broader context."
