  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual focus on time (pocket watch, hourglass) closely matches the video title\u2019s question about duration. Use of 'S*X' in both text and images directly alludes to the video's subject. The presence of a doctor in scrubs visually supports the medical/expertise angle promised in the title ('Dr. Sunil Jindal | Jindal Hospital Meerut').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts or mismatches. However, the use of the term 'truth revealed' in the title is not explicitly shown in the visuals, though the authoritative presence of a doctor and scientific props imply expertise and truthful information."
