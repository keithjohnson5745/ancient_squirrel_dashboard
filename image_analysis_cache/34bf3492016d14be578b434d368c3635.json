  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses a direct visual metaphor (cucumber/measuring tape) for penis length, matching the video's explicit title. The question in bold text mirrors the title's central topic. The presence of a urologist aligns with 'Urologist Explains' in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Both are closely aligned in tone and content. The thumbnail uses humor and innuendo, which is less clinical than 'science' in the title, but the inclusion of a professional suggests credibility. The thumbnail suggests a playful but informative video consistent with the title\u2019s promise."
