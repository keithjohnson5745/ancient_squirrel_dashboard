    "Contrasts or Mismatches": "While the title claims to offer 'best tips' (potentially educational), the thumbnail heavily leans on sexual innuendo and visual suggestion, which could be perceived as more provocative/clickbait than informative. The presence of a professional (doctor) attempts to balance this by adding a layer of legitimacy."
