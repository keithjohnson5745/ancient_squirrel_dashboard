  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses explicit measurement imagery (tape measure, face arrows) to mirror the title\u2019s focus on 'find out her ideal size.' The question in bold text echoes the video\u2019s curiosity-driven angle. The combination of a medical professional and facial measurements hints at a 'scientific trick,' aligning with the title's promise.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title is more explicit and provocative, directly referencing 'DICK' size in a way the thumbnail does not. The thumbnail keeps the imagery and language safe for general audiences, using suggestive symbols rather than overt references, maintaining plausible deniability and YouTube\u2019s content guidelines."
