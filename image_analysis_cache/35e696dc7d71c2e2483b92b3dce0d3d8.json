The warning tone of the title is reinforced by the text 'NEW SCAM' and 'AVOID THIS', creating a sense of urgency.",
      "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail focuses on a single example (one engine part and mechanic action), while the title suggests a list of 13 scams. There is a slight mismatch in scale (one scam or situation, vs. 13 in the video), but the tone and visual messaging align closely."
