  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "thumbnail_reinforces_title": "Yes, strongly. The thumbnail visually depicts the exact question in the title (adding graphite to motor oil) by showing a hand receiving a substantial amount of black graphite powder. The text on the thumbnail echoes the video title, reinforcing the experimental nature and focus.",
    "contrasts_or_mismatches": "No major mismatch. Thumbnail is consistent with the video's central question. One slight difference is the thumbnail visually focuses on the act of pouring graphite, while the title also references a comparison between 'Vintage Arco Graphite vs Quaker State,' which isn't visually represented."
