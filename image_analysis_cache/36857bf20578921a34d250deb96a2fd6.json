The presence of Dr. Milhouse suggests expert explanation, matching the 'THE TRUTH' in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatches. The only subtle difference is that the woman\u2019s skeptical/funny face adds a slight tone of questioning or myth-busting, hinting at a discussion rather than strictly negative framing."
