The prominent text echoes the title, making clear the video's content is about regret/enthusiasm for acquiring these items.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail only displays five items, while the title refers to twelve; this is a standard YouTube practice to keep thumbnails simple and clickable but may leave some viewers expecting a broader product range than visually shown. Aside from this, the imagery and message are consistent."
