  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image clearly depicts people selling fresh produce (melon, squash, vegetables) at a roadside market. This directly aligns with the title\u2019s reference to going to the market to sell vegetables to buy food for a new mother dog.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no explicit sign of a dog or dog food, but the transactional aspect (selling vegetables at the market) is visually represented. The connection to the 'new mother dog' is implicit rather than shown."
