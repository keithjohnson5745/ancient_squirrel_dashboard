  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail repeats the main keyword phrase 'BASIC VENT MODES,' directly matching the start of the title. The illustrated ventilator visually links to 'Ventilator Settings Reviewed' and provides context that this is a medical/critical care educational video. The use of approachable, comic-style text and imagery matches the promise of 'MADE EASY.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail omits the 'MADE EASY' and 'Ventilator Settings Reviewed' phrases, instead relying on visuals and the word 'BASIC' to suggest simplicity. The ICU and medical icons reinforce the medical setting, although the exact phrase 'Reviewed' is not directly addressed in the thumbnail."
