    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches; both focus on a dramatic military event involving a U.S. fighter jet under attack. The lack of visible Houthis or enemy presence might slightly abstract the 'who' of the title, but the visual narrative is consistent with the title's premise."
