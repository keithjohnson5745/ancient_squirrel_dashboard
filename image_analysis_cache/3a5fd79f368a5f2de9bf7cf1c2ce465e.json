  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The bold text 'TWO WEEK WAIT' directly references the key phrase from the title. The pregnancy test and calendar illustration visually represent the context of waiting related to fertility, reinforcing the video's focus on infertility and coping strategies during this specific anxious period. The host's facial expression amplifies the emotional aspect suggested by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong match between thumbnail and title; all visual cues (pregnancy test, calendar, facial expression) and the text support the thematic content around waiting and infertility. The only minor gap is that the thumbnail does not explicitly address 'coping strategies,' focusing more on the anxious wait itself."
