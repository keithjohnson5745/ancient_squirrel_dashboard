  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title\u2019s question about visiting a nudist beach by showing an explicit sign for a naturist beach, which links concretely to the video's main subject and the implied adventure.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatches; both thumbnail and title center on the question of visiting a nudist location. The thumbnail does not reference the 'drukke camperspot bij Villaricos' (busy camper spot at Villaricos), which is in the title but not depicted, so the focus is skewed towards the nudist beach theme."
