    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image literally portrays the premise described in the video title: a human 'testing' a crow, presumably on intelligence, using a chess game as the test \u2013 directly supporting 'Testing The World's Smartest Crow.' The thoughtful pose of the human and the crow standing among chess pieces visually dramatize the idea of a battle of wits.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatch; the thumbnail strongly reinforces the video\u2019s theme by presenting an exaggerated but clear visual metaphor for animal intelligence being tested in a human context."
