      "Beige/Brown": "5% (table surface, skin tone)"
    },
    "Composition type": "Medium close-up: one person occupies the right half in focus, objects (juice, clown emoji) and text on the left.",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expressions": "Neutral to serious, index finger raised in a warning gesture.",

    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, uppercase sans-serif",

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail strongly reinforces the video's title. The visual command 'STOP DRINKING THIS' directly supports the promised 'DARK Truth about Fruit Juices.'

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no explicit reference in the thumbnail to the 'court case' or the creator's personal stake alluded to in the title. The thumbnail focuses exclusively on the juice/consumer deception part, not on legal or personal aspects."
