    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment\u2014both focus on menopause and the new non-hormonal drug; the only slight mismatch is that the visuals are more generally about midlife and menopause rather than the drug alone, but this broadens rather than detracts from relevance."
