    "Visual Reinforcement of Title": "The thumbnail depicts a caregiver or health worker greeting a smiling senior woman at her residence, visually reinforcing the 'Emergency Medical Services at John Knox Village' by directly showing human interaction, care, and home environment which aligns with the resident/patient care theme implied by the title.",
    "Contrasts or Mismatches": "There is no dramatic emergency scene\u2014rather, the moment captured is calm, friendly, and routine, which may contrast with viewers who expect urgent or dramatic medical action, given the word 'Emergency' in the title. However, the subtitle in the thumbnail ('Emergency & Non-Emergency Services') does expand the context to include a spectrum of care."
