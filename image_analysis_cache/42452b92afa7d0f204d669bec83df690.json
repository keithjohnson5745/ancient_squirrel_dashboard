    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expression": "Holding nose in a gesture of displeasure/disgust, neutral face, directly engaging camera",

    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [
      "Person holding nose (implies odor, common period-related concern)",
      "Sanitary pad stained with red (immediate association to menstruation)"
    ],
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Use of 'SECRETS'",
      "Exaggerated gesture (nose-holding expression for drama)",

    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit brand or logo visible in the thumbnail"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The graphic and bold showing of a menstrual pad, combined with the phrase 'PERIOD HYGIENE SECRETS,' strongly reinforces the promise of exclusive or revealing information about period hygiene, matching the video's title. The visual gesture of holding the nose adds a relatable (if slightly exaggerated) element of discomfort that can occur if hygiene is not maintained\u2014tying directly to hygiene tips.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail has a sensational and potentially negative tone (nose-holding for odor), which slightly contrasts with the generally positive and helpful tone expected from the educational title. While the title emphasizes learning and tips, the thumbnail emphasizes problems (odor/blood), perhaps to increase clicks via curiosity or concern."
