    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The exact supplement is not mentioned or shown, maintaining curiosity and driving clicks (aligned with clickbait strategy). The thumbnail and title both use emotionally charged language, but the supplement's identity remains hidden, intentionally creating an information gap."
