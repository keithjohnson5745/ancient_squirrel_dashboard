    "Visually reinforces title": "Yes; the text in the thumbnail closely matches the video title, using the most emotionally charged words.

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatch. The visual style is direct, bold, and matches the promise of insider knowledge in the title. The only minor difference is the thumbnail lays heavier visual emphasis on 'YOU KNEW' and 'FREE MASTERCLASS', concretely reinforcing the video's main selling points."
