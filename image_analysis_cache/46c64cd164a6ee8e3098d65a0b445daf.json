  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail prominently highlights both 'PCOS' and 'INFERTILITY'\u2014key terms from the video title\u2014using large, bold, central text. The setup of two people in conversation (possibly an expert and interviewer) visually implies the educational or informative discussion referenced in the title ('What Every Woman Needs to Know!').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses 'INFERTILITY' as a trigger word rather than the more clinical and inclusive 'Fertility' in the title; it also appeals potentially to a wider audience with a dramatic tone ('WHAT'S THE TRUTH?') instead of directly saying 'What Every Woman Needs to Know.' The tone of the thumbnail may come off as slightly more dramatic or urgent than the neutral and supportive wording of the title."
