  "VISUAL ELEMENTS": {
    "Dominant colors": {
      "Blue": "Approx. 60% (background grid)",
      "Black": "Approx. 20% (text boxes, MOSFET body)",
      "White": "Approx. 10% (text, arrow, MOSFET legs)",
      "Yellow": "Approx. 10% (border)"
    },
    "Composition type": "Medium close-up (single MOSFET electronic component prominently displayed)",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 0,
      "Expressions": "N/A",
      "Demographics": "N/A"
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "MOSFET transistor (IRFZ44N, shown clearly with model number visible)",
      "Large white curved arrow (points to MOSFET)"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Solid blue grid/graph paper pattern suggesting technical/engineering context, framed with a bright yellow border"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "Visible text": "HOW MOSFETS WORK",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, sans-serif, all uppercase",
      "Emphasis": "Very high, with white text on black rectangular backgrounds for maximum contrast and readability",
      "Color": "White text on black background"
    },
    "Text placement": "Left side of the thumbnail, stacked vertically in three lines ('HOW' on top, 'MOSFETS' in the middle, 'WORK' at the bottom)",
    "Emotional/trigger words": [
      "HOW",
      "WORK"
    ],
    "Notes": "Technical clarity is prioritized, no overtly emotional or exaggerated language"
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Instructional, clear, and technical; aims to educate rather than provoke strong emotion",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "The large white arrow functions as a visual guide, indicating focus on the MOSFET and suggesting action/process ('how it works')",
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Direct how-to phrasing ('HOW MOSFETS WORK')",
      "Simple, high-contrast visual design",
      "Large, easy-to-read text"
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "Yellow borderline is a common motif used to convey brand consistency in educational/engineering YouTube channels, but no explicit branding/logos"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Thumbnail reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly reinforces the title by visually depicting a MOSFET (with part number visible), accompanied by the explanatory phrase 'HOW MOSFETS WORK', creating a strong, immediate conceptual link to the video\u2019s topic.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No notable contrasts or mismatches; thumbnail and title are highly aligned\u2014both focus on MOSFETs and the idea of explanation/instruction.",
    "Summary": "Clear, direct, cohesive representation linking the visual and textual elements to the educational intent of the video."
