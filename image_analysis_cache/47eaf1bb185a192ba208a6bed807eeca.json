  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail's text ('BEST LUBRICANT FOR PREGNANCY' and named options) directly corresponds to the video's topic about fertility lubricants. The visual of a woman holding two bottles emphasizes making a choice between different lubricant types, which matches the title's comparison of fertility lubricants.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail uses the phrase 'FOR PREGNANCY' while the video title references 'TTC' (trying to conceive); this is closely related but slightly different wording. The video title promises to inform viewers about what is 'safe' before buying\u2014while the thumbnail visually and textually stresses confusion and option comparison, it doesn\u2019t explicitly mention 'safety.' Overall, both thumbnail and title are strongly aligned in theme and message."
