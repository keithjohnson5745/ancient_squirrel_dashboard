  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail's glowing Phi symbol (the golden ratio) directly references the topic in the title. The use of pyramids in the background hints at the frequent association of the golden ratio with ancient structures (often a subject of myth or controversy). The spiral overlay is a visual icon for the golden ratio. The person's amazed expression visually asks the same question posed in the video title ('Is it myth or math?').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No direct mismatch. The thumbnail is tightly aligned with the title, using universally recognized symbols and visual tropes linked to both myth and mathematics, thus embodying the video's central question."
