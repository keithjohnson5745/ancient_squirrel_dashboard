  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail prominently displays voluminous, well-defined curls and the word 'After,' visually supporting the video's theme of testing curly hair routines and drugstore products. The outcome implicitly claims success using accessible (drugstore) products, aligning with the promise of the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no obvious mismatches; however, the thumbnail does not display any drugstore products, so the 'testing' aspect is implied rather than shown directly. The viewer only sees the 'after' result, not the process or the products used."
