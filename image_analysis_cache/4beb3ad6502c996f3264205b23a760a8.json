    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image shows a TED speaker in mid-presentation, suggesting a serious, authoritative discussion\u2014consistent with the title's framing of a thoughtful, open reconsideration of infidelity and love.",

However, this visual neutrality and professionalism is typical for TED and may lend further weight to the talk\u2019s seriousness."
