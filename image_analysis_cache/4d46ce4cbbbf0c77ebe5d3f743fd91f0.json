  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly supports the provocative and instructive title ('If You're Not Doing This with WD-40 You're Stupid') by showing an actual can of WD-40 in use and highlighting an unrevealed 'secret' area with an arrow. The focus on the product and the word 'Secret' triggers curiosity and aligns with the promise of the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major contrasts. However, while the title is more aggressively worded ('You're Stupid'), the thumbnail avoids harsh language in text, opting to tease a secret instead. This softens the tone visually while still encouraging a click."
