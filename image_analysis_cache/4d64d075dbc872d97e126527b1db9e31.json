  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly visualizes the 'then' part of the title by showing an individual happily using baby oil in the past, setting up for a humorous or dramatic contrast with 'now' as promised by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail only displays the 'then' scenario, not the 'now' scenario, creating curiosity. The use of the \ud83d\udc80 emoji in the title builds anticipation for a funny or shocking 'now' contrast, which is not reflected visually in this thumbnail, making it a classic 'part one' setup."
