  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail pairs the explicit topic (\u2018How to have ANAL SEX\u2019) directly with both the title and prominent on-screen text.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The visual tone is considerably softer and more abstract (cartoon/illustrative, relaxed) than some might expect from the directness of the title ('first-time anal tips'). No explicit content or medical imagery\u2014this may reduce intimidation and make the subject more approachable, potentially broadening the audience compared to a more clinical or provocative visual style."
