  "VISUAL ELEMENTS": {
    "Dominant colors": {
      "Black": "Approximately 50% (background and main text bars)",
      "White": "Approximately 45% (text areas, digital network lines, brain overlay)",
      "Gray": "Approximately 5% (shading, grayscale portrait)"
    },
    "Composition type": "Close-up/side profile of a human head with a digital brain overlay.",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expressions": "Neutral, side-profile view with no overt emotional expression visible.",
      "Demographics": "Appears to be an adult female based on facial structure, but ethnicity is indeterminate due to grayscale and stylization."
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": "Side-profile image of a human head, digitally overlaid with an abstract brain/neural network consisting of white lines and nodes.",
    "Background environment": "Solid black backdrop with overlaid digital/technological patterns representing neural connections."
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "WHAT BETRAYAL TRAUMA DOES TO THE BRAIN",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, sans-serif, uppercase letters throughout.",
      "Emphasis": "Heavy use of bold font; the word 'BRAIN' is particularly emphasized (larger and bolder than surrounding text).",
      "Color": "Black text on white for upper part, black text on light-gray/white for lower part."
    },
    "Text placement within frame": {
      "Top": "WHAT BETRAYAL TRAUMA (centered, large)",
      "Middle right": "DOES TO THE (stacked, right-aligned)",
      "Bottom right": "BRAIN (large, heavily emphasized, in a rounded rectangle)"
    },
    "Use of emotional/trigger words": [
      "Betrayal",
      "Trauma",
      "Brain"
    ]
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Serious, analytical, and scientific with a subtle undertone of urgency or gravity due to the stark contrast and emphasis on trauma.",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [
      "Neural network/brain diagram overlaid on human head symbolizes the scientific exploration of mental and neurological impacts.",
      "Black-and-white color scheme conveys seriousness and credibility."
    ],
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Direct question/statement implying important information ('WHAT BETRAYAL TRAUMA DOES TO THE BRAIN').",
      "Heavy emphasis on a consequential keyword ('BRAIN') to imply critical effects.",
      "Visual of a brain/networks to evoke curiosity about neuroscience."
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No specific logos or recurring brand marks. Design is clean and clinical, possibly aiming for broad authority rather than personal branding."
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly mirrors the video title with the same or very similar wording, making the subject instantly clear. The use of an overlaid brain/neural network visually supports the focus on psychological/neurobiological impact (the brain), while the serious grayscale palette sets an appropriate tone for trauma and science.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches. Both thumbnail and title are tightly aligned in theme, language, and visual representation. The thumbnail effectively delivers on the promise of the title."
