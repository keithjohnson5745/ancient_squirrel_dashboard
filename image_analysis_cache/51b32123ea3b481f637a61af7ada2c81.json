      "RAM truck (automotive brand, but not channel-specific branding visible)",
      "Possible subtle emphasis on vehicle expertise/mechanic theme"

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The questioning word 'SERIOUSLY?' and the skeptical expression reinforce the title\u2019s theme of unresolved controversy or disbelief regarding a 'mystery' with the vehicle (No Start issue). The garage setting and close-up of the truck make clear that the topic is about automotive troubleshooting, linking to 'your COMMENTS solved this mystery.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not specifically visualize the role of 'comments' or 'audience participation' as the title does, and the phrase 'No Start' or the solving of a 'mystery' is not explicit in the visual, which relies on inference from the expressive cues."
