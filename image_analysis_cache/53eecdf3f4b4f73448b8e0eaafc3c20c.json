  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly visualizes the main subject of the title ('500lbs of Lube') by showing a large blue barrel clearly labeled 'NATURAL LUBE,' accompanied by the shocked and amused reactions of the people present. The absurdity referenced in the title is mirrored in the image's emotional tone and props.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches; the thumbnail and title work synergistically to emphasize humor, shock, and excess. The explicit reference to 'AMAZON Made Me Buy' is not visually referenced, but the 'EXTENDED VERSION' is not directly addressed in the thumbnail either."
