  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly supports the title \"What Makes ADHD in Women Different\" by showing a woman overwhelmed with multitasking (childcare, housework, email overload, reading, and work). This chaos and overwhelm connects to common ADHD experiences, especially as reported by many women.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts. The imagery successfully emphasizes both 'ADHD' (overwhelm, distraction, stimuli overload) and 'Women' (female-presenting main character, juggling stereotypically female-associated tasks). The illustration is a bit exaggerated for clarity, which is typical in informative or attention-grabbing thumbnails."
