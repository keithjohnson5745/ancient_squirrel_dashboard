  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The close-up of the speaker on a TEDx stage with a headset microphone visually reinforces that this is an expert talk, which matches the informative nature of the title. The speaker\u2019s gesture and expression reflect openness and approachability, aligning with the theme of sharing knowledge ('What you don't know about hearing aids').",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail does not directly visually reference 'hearing aids' or depict them, which may create a mild disconnect for viewers seeking an immediate visual cue. The focus is on the speaker rather than the topic device."
