    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No direct mismatch, but the thumbnail focuses more on a shocking personal habit rather than explicitly referencing 'porn.' However, the connection is inferred through context. The serious expression visually matches the gravity implied in the title."
