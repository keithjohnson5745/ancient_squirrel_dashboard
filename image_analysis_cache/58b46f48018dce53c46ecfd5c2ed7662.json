  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail explicitly shows an exaggerated handcare routine: white cream/powder thickly layered on a hand, being treated with a Hello Kitty-branded tool, which matches the 'excessive' aspect. The presence of the commentator foregrounds the 'reaction' format.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches. The playful/childlike Hello Kitty tool could be seen as a humorous twist versus a strict skincare routine, and the visible extremeness visually overstates the 'excessive' claim in the title, aligning well for engagement purposes."
