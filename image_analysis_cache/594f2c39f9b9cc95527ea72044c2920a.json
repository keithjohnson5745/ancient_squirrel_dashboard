  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a white police officer shaving the head of a Black woman in what is clearly a courtroom or official setting, directly depicting the core incident described in the title. The visual focus on power dynamics, humiliation, and the racial context strongly reinforces the title's narrative about injustice and reversal ('then froze when she took the bench').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail only shows the act of shaving and the apparent distress of the Black woman, not her subsequent empowerment (as suggested by 'took the bench'). The moment of 'the cop freezing' is not visually represented, focusing instead on the injustice rather than the reversal."
