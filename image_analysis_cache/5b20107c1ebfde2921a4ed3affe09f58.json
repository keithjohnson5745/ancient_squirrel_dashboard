  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail visually emphasizes 'CASTOR OIL' and 'FOR FACE' in extremely large, bold text, immediately clarifying the subject. The bottle of castor oil and the person pointing to their face visually reinforce the notion of facial application. The inclusion of a human (possibly a dermatologist, as per the title) adds trust and matches the 'explains' aspect.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no explicit mention of 'Top 5 Benefits' or that the person is a dermatologist in the thumbnail; the focus is more on what the castor oil is for rather than a specific 'top 5' or credentials."
