    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatches; the visual elements (questioning expression, pills, magnifying glass) directly relate to the title\u2019s subject. The thumbnail uses a slightly more generic phrase ('CAN IT HELP??') rather than stating 'shrink your prostate,' possibly to broaden the curiosity appeal."
