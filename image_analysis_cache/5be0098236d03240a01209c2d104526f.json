  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title with a clear, direct image of twins (central topic) and highlights their rarity with the word 'RARE' and a graphic arrow, which accentuates the uniqueness discussed in the title '6 Types of Twins That Are Extremely Rare.'",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "While the thumbnail clearly conveys the idea of twins and rare occurrence, it only shows one set of twins (not six types), which simplifies rather than diversifies the concept promised by the title. The focus is on visual clarity and immediate connection rather than literal completeness."
