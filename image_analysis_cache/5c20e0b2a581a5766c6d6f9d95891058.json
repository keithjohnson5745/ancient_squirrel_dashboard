  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail\u2019s urgent message (\u201cif you want 2+ children you need to know this!\u201d) echoes the title\u2019s concern about fertility timelines and specific advice. The presence of a woman and a man with microphones enhances the sense of expert, authoritative discussion which aligns with the \u2018Pregnancy Doctor\u2019 reference in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title is more explicit and data-driven about pregnancy declining after age 32, which is not directly referenced in the thumbnail. The thumbnail focuses on headline-style urgency but doesn\u2019t visually include pregnancy-specific images (like babies, medical charts, etc.), relying instead on dialogue and authority implied via the interview setup."
