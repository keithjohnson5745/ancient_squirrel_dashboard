  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a person presenting a prominently labeled box in a store environment surrounded by what appear to be adult or personal products. This directly supports the title 'Honeymoon packs available in India' by visually confirming the existence and availability of honeymoon-related product packs.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No apparent mismatch. The thumbnail is consistent with the title\u2019s promise. However, the box's specific contents aren\u2019t clear, so those seeking 'honeymoon pack' details might expect more explicit visual cues of romantic/honeymoon themes or contents inside the box."
