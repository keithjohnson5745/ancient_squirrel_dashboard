  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail conveys absurdity and unexpected connections (dolls, pencils, Alcatraz) that align with the satirical and questioning tone of the title ('Trump on Upholding Constitution: \"I Don't Know\" | The Daily Show'). The inclusion of the public figure who is presumably Trump and The Daily Show host visually supports the context of political satire.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail's objects (dolls, pencils, Alcatraz) are not directly mentioned in the title, creating intrigue and promising unexpected comedic twists. The serious political topic suggested by the title contrasts with the playful, almost nonsensical visuals, enhancing comedic appeal."
