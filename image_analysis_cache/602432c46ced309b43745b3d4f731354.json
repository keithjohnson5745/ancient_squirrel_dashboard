  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The title ('Payleey Called Me Out..') suggests drama/conflict or direct interaction. The thumbnail visually supports this by showing the individual YouTuber (left) and the Roblox avatar (right, who is likely \u2018Payleey\u2019 or representing them) side-by-side, both with expressive faces as if reacting to each other. The halo over the avatar may indicate irony or highlight the contrast between perceived innocence/goodness and being 'called out.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches. The lack of text in the thumbnail places full reliance on visuals, making the title necessary for context. The friendly expressions may soften the expected 'drama' implied by 'called me out,' giving a more playful or lighthearted tone than a serious confrontation."
