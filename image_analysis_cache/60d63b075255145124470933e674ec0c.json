  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The large, bold text in the thumbnail precisely mirrors the dramatic language in the title, focusing on the 'control' aspect and presenting it as a warning; the use of an authoritative figure (older man, formal attire) visually supports 'Former FBI Agent' from the title, lending credibility and seriousness. The right individual's stern expression mirrors the perceived danger.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment overall; no significant mismatches. The thumbnail directly visualizes the key elements referenced in the title (authority figure, element of danger, psychological manipulation). The only potential minor mismatch is that the actual former FBI agent is not labeled as such in the thumbnail, but implied through appearance."
