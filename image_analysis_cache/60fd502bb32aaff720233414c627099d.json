    },
    "Composition type": "Medium shot (person shown from thigh/waist up, graphics and text take up large portion of frame)",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expressions": "Confident, slightly smiling",
      "Demographics (apparent)": "Young adult male, muscular, light/medium skin, short black hair, visible body tattoo"

    "Main objects/props featured": [
      "Person flexing and revealing muscular abdomen",
      "Two fat depictions (before/after transformation) inside white circles",
      "Large rightward arrow between fat depictions"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Minimalist, flat dark gradient (no environmental context)"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "THIS KILLS BODY FAT",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, all uppercase, sans-serif",
      "Emphasis": "Word 'KILLS' in yellow for extra emphasis; rest of text in white",
      "Color": "'KILLS' is yellow, rest is white"

    "Brand elements present": "No overt branding (e.g., logos), but the person could be recognized as the creator"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual shows a dramatic reduction in body fat (before/after) directly referencing the core theme of 'getting lean' from the title. The muscular individual next to the fat loss graphic is a strong visual argument for the video's premise.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail promises a rapid/decisive solution ('KILLS'), while the title is phrased more as an explanation ('Why 90% of People Never Get Lean') with an added call to action ('Do This Instead'). The thumbnail is more aggressive/direct than the informative/curious tone of the title, but both share the promise of fat loss."
