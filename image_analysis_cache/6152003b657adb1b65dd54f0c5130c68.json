  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "visual_reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by showing a gloved hand (suggesting medical procedure or exam) and the word 'Prostate Massage' which reinforces the video\u2019s content about prostate massage. The pointing woman adds a sense of endorsement or explanation, drawing viewer attention to the gloved hand (i.e., the \u2018massage\u2019 technique/reference).",
    "contrasts_or_mismatches": "No major mismatch; the thumbnail is highly aligned with the title, both emphasizing prostate massage. The only mild thematic contrast is that the friendly, almost playful expression and bright background make a potentially sensitive topic appear approachable and less clinical."
