  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual comparison ('vs.') and the bottles directly represent the subject (olive oil). The woman\u2019s serious expression and the blunt text address ('This mistake ruins olive oil') reinforce the theme of unlocking health benefits by avoiding mistakes. The Zoe brand connects thumbnail and content to authoritative nutrition advice.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment: both focus on olive oil and maximizing its benefits, warning against errors. The thumbnail emphasizes the idea of common mistakes visually, but does not directly mention 'unlocking health benefits' \u2014 instead, it uses a negative framing (ruining) for click-attracting impact."
