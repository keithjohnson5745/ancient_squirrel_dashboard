The anti-aging and menopause elements from the title are immediately visible through the text boxes.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No overt mismatch; both title and thumbnail clearly convey the same themes: expertise on topical estrogen for aging/menopausal skin, potential skepticism about 'miracle' claims. If anything, the thumbnail\u2019s boldness increases the sense of urgency or controversy slightly more than the title alone."
