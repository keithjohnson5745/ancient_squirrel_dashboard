  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The clear, bold text in the thumbnail closely matches the instructional nature of the video title, promising practical advice on stain removal. The lab coats and demonstration setting strengthen the perception of expert instruction.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text says 'STAINS' generally, while the title specifically mentions 'LUBE STAINS'. The thumbnail avoids the word 'lube' entirely, likely aiming for broader appeal and reduced embarrassment/trigger factor. This can create a slight mismatch for viewers searching specifically for 'lube' stain solutions, but increases clickability for a wider audience."
