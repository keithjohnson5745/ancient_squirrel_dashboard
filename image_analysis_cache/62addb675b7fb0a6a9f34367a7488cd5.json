  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail explicitly echoes the video's title with visual cues: the word 'HYSTERIA' is paired next to a fainted, vintage-dressed woman (referencing the historical diagnosis), while 'VIBRATORS' is highlighted by the presenter holding a bright pink vibrator. Both words from the title are visually emphasized. The contrast in image style (historical photo vs. modern-day presenter) reinforces the narrative of 'the shocking truth' bridging past and present.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches. The thumbnail aligns closely with the subject and tone implied by the title. The only mild contrast is in tone: the bright, almost playful look of the pink vibrator contrasts the historical seriousness of the black-and-white imagery, which may intrigue or surprise viewers, potentially increasing click-through rates."
