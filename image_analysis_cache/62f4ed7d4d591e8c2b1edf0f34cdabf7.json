  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually and textually addresses the central question of penis size, which is the main topic of the video. The banana and eggplant are visual stand-ins for penises, tapping into common meme/emoji language. The text ('YOU ARE NOT THAT BIG') directly appeals to (and challenges) concerns about average size, hooking viewers who are curious, concerned or amused by the topic. The worried facial expression mirrors the awkwardness and curiosity implied by the video title's promise to answer 'male questions.'",
    "Contrast/mismatches": "The thumbnail uses humor/visual innuendo (food metaphors, exaggerated cartoon style) to discuss a sensitive topic, which is consistent with the likely informative yet lighthearted tone of the video. There is no significant mismatch; the approach is direct but coded to remain YouTube-friendly."
