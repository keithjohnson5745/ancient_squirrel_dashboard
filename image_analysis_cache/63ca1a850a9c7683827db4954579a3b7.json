  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by directly referencing a surprising or lesser-known risk (\u2018WHEN IS NORMAL DELIVERY A RISK?\u2019). The included text suggests expert discussion (with the presence of two people and podcast-style setup), implying important information viewers 'don\u2019t know.' The use of emotional and urgent design choices draws attention to the seriousness of the topic.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The title suggests new or unknown pregnancy information (\u201899% of Women Don\u2019t Know This About Pregnancy!\u2019), while the thumbnail narrows the focus specifically to risks associated with normal delivery, rather than pregnancy in general. The thumbnail\u2019s tone is more urgent/danger-focused versus the title\u2019s implication of discovery or knowledge gap."
