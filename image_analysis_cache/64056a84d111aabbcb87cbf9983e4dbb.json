    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": [
      "Thumbnail does not contain text, so the trigger words from the title ('losing it', 'tone-deaf', 'whinge-fest') are conveyed only through imagery.",
      "No obvious political affiliations are shown visually besides facial reactions, so the 'Lefties' reference is left implicit for viewers familiar with the subjects.",
      "No other symbols or graphics (like warning signs, exclamation points) to amplify emotional tone beyond the faces/gestures."
