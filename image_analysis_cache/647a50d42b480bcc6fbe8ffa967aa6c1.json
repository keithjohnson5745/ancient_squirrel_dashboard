  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image features a well-known political figure, which directly relates to 'Trump\u2019 in the title. The serious tone of the image visually matches the shocking language in the title ('OMG', 'ACTUAL reason', 'REVEALED'), signaling an important or dramatic disclosure.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "While the title specifically mentions 'Alcatraz scheme' and suggests a dramatic, potentially sensational topic, the thumbnail itself does not visually represent Alcatraz, prisons, or any explicit 'scheme'; it focuses solely on the individual. This might create curiosity but does not visually match the 'scheme' or 'Alcatraz' element for viewers seeking visual cues."
