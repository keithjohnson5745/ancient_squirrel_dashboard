  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "Strongly aligned: The main title 'STI PREVENTION BEYOND CONDOMS' is the largest text, identical to the video title, and visually dominant. The classroom setting and demonstration board showing multiple STI prevention tools (external/internal condom, dental dam) directly illustrate 'beyond condoms.' The friendly cartoon style lowers barriers to learning about sensitive topics.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "None apparent. The thumbnail and title are consistent. The presence of both condom illustrations and a dental dam supports the idea that the content is about more than just condoms, matching 'beyond' in the title."
