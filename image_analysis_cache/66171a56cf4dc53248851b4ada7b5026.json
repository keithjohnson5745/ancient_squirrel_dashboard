      "Person's outstretched hand, palm up (as if gesturing to the text or embryo illustration)"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Flat, light blue background; no real environment depicted; clean and clinical aesthetic"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "YOUR OPTIONS FOR EMBRYO GENETIC TESTING",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "style": "Bold sans-serif, all capital letters",
      "emphasis": "Strong emphasis through boldness and high contrast",
      "color": "White text (on blue background for 'EMBRYO', 'GENETIC', 'TESTING'; on light blue background for 'YOUR OPTIONS FOR')"

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "Thumbnail directly visualizes the topic of 'genetic screening of embryos' with the embryo illustration and large text highlighting 'EMBRYO GENETIC TESTING.' The presence of a medical professional (presumably Dr. Lora Shahine) adds authority and aligns with the title's educational and consultative tone.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "Thumb text uses 'Genetic Testing' rather than the broader 'Genetic Screening' used in the full title; overall, the focus is more on clinical options rather than personal decision-making, though the outstretched hand and 'YOUR OPTIONS' text invite viewer engagement."
