  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The subject holds a Durex-branded lubricant product directly toward the camera, visually confirming the product focus mentioned in the title. The straightforward display reinforces the review/unboxing aspect, aligning with the keywords ('review', 'Durex', 'lubricant', 'gel') in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title refers to specific uses such as 'delay gel', 'massage lube', and 'for anal sex', but the thumbnail itself is neutral: it does not allude directly to any sexual context or use, nor does it visually highlight the distinctions between Durex product types beyond a generic lubricant tube. The inclusion of phone number and unrelated YouTube handle might distract from the video's main topic."
