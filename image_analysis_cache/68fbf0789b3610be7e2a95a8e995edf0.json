The bold, urgent style matches the urgency and embarrassment implied by the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a close alignment with no notable contrasts; both title and thumbnail are direct, use similar language, and focus on the same issue. The thumbnail does not use euphemisms, directly mirroring the explicit subject raised in the title, which may be seen as potentially clickbait or provocative. Both work together to create curiosity and a sense of urgency for viewers facing the issue."
