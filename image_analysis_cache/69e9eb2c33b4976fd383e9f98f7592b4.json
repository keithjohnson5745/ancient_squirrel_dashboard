  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail visually supports the educational and myth-busting focus suggested by the title. The charts refer to hormonal cycles, directly tying to 'hormonal abnormalities' in PCOS, and props (brain, egg) symbolize medical/scientific explanation.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail's main text ('NOT EVEN HALF THE TRUTH') is more provocative than the fairly clinical title, suggesting a more sensational or myth-busting tone than the title alone, but overall, both indicate in-depth, possibly contrarian insights into PCOS."
