  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly visualizes the title's premise: it depicts a shark in a swimming pool, matching the fear mentioned in 'MY DEEPEST FEAR' and echoing 'There's a SHARK in the POOL.' The inset reaction amplifies the sense of terror from the personal angle.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "No significant contrast; both the title and thumbnail use exaggeration and implausibility for dramatic effect. The thumbnail does not show the text 'Sharks And Minnows,' but the imagery evokes the game's fear scenario."
