  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail's direct, bold text visually matches the title's theme of increased sexual performance and 'rock-hard' results. The prominent nasal spray bottle in the center visually literalizes the 'nasal spray' mentioned in the title, and the excited/attractive expressions of the women suggest positive, pleasurable outcomes, reinforcing the claimed results.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no explicit visual reference to 'ED' (erectile dysfunction) or to a male subject, despite this being the title's focus; the women in the thumbnail (especially the one in medical scrubs) instead suggest authority and sexual satisfaction, indirectly referencing the benefit rather than the problem."
