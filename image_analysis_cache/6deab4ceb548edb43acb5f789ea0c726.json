  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail pairs the terms 'EDGING' and 'Intense Orgasm?!' with a visual equation, echoing the video\u2019s focus on explaining the 'edging' technique and questioning its safety or link to orgasm. The presence of a professional (urologist) reinforces the explanation/educational aspect of the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatch; while the thumbnail focuses on the potential outcome or question ('Intense Orgasm?!'), the title also highlights the educational element ('Urologist explains', 'is it SAFE?!'), which is visually represented by the professional presence in the thumbnail. The thumbnail leans more into provocation/interest than caution, which is a slight contrast to the safety question in the title."
