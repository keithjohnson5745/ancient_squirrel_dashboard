The large text directly references 'Porn Addiction,' matching the topic in the title. The woman\u2019s gentle demeanor helps communicate a thoughtful, first-person narrative rather than shock or shame.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text says 'Living with Porn Addiction' (a present-tense, ongoing focus) while the video title ('A Woman's Experience') frames it as an individual case study or narrative\u2014both are closely related, but the title is more narrative while the thumbnail text is general/informative. Nonetheless, both are largely harmonious and supportive of each other."
