    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "MANUAL DRAINAGE FOR MASTITIS RELIEF",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "style": "Bold, sans-serif, all uppercase",

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail text directly echoes the core keywords from the title ('manual drainage', 'mastitis', 'relief'). The person in medical attire with an anatomical model visually supports the promise of expert, gentle techniques for medical relief.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text omits the specific reference to 'lymphatic' and 'breast engorgement', instead focusing only on 'mastitis'. The model shown is a pelvis, which may not be directly related to breast anatomy, introducing a minor visual mismatch with the topic (mastitis is breast-related). However, the overall professional medical context is clear."
