  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly addresses breasts both visually (close-up of a woman covering her bare chest, stylized breast graphics) and with the question-driven text, matching the video's promise to discuss breast and nipple information. The medical and educational cues align with the idea of important 'must know' facts.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatch present. Both thumbnail and title are focused, but the thumbnail emphasizes 'normalcy' (Are your breasts normal?) while the title is broader ('things you must know'), possibly making the topic seem more about reassurance/diagnosis than holistic education."
