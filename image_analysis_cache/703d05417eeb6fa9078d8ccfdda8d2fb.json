  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses props (pills, supplements), a doctor figure (medical authenticity), and direct reference to male improvement ('Superman' shadow, victorious businessman), which aligns with the Hindi title promising '\u092e\u0930\u094d\u0926 \u0915\u0947 5 \u092a\u0949\u0935\u0930 \u091f\u0947\u092c\u0932\u0947\u091f' (5 Power Tablets for Men / 5 Essential Supplements for Men). Both suggest these are essential, powerful, and transformative for men.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "While the thumbnail says 'Superman Supplements' (not the literal title's 'Power Tablets'), the imagery and overall implication match the title\u2019s promise of boosting male strength and vitality. The use of English text in the thumbnail, compared to a Hindi title, may mildly contrast for a purely Hindi-speaking audience."
