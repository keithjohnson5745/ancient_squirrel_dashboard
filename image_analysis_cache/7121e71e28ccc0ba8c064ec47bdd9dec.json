  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail depicts Harry and Meghan physically separated from their supposed 'allies' (three other people), which visually supports the title's claim of them being isolated and Harry only having Meghan as his ally. The triggered use of 'DUMPED BY ALLIES' further underscores the narrative of social abandonment following a controversy.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title specifically references a 'disastrous BBC interview,' but the thumbnail does not visually reference the interview or the BBC. The thumbnail focuses entirely on personal relationships and alliance drama instead. Additionally, the thumbnail directly references both Harry and Meghan being 'dumped,' while the title emphasizes Harry's isolation, with Meghan as his only remaining ally \u2014 a more nuanced framing."
