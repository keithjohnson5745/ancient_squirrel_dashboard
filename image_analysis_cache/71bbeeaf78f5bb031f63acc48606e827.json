  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual focus on the woman in a meditative/thoughtful pose directly connects to the idea of 'visualisation.' The text reinforces that positive thinking (often considered part of visualisation/fertility mindset content) is valuable and not just mystical or unscientific, matching the self-help/personal improvement theme suggested by both title and thumbnail.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text does not explicitly mention pregnancy or fertility, while the video title specifically addresses visualisation for falling pregnant. The thumbnail instead broadens the message to positive thinking in general, which could attract a wider audience or intentionally avoid alienating skeptical viewers."
