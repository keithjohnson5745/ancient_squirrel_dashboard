  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": [
      "The title references 'Awaken The Female Desire' and 'Arousal Meditation Music,' which is visually echoed by the explosive, radiant center of the image. The energetic burst could symbolize awakening or arousal of energy/frequency.",

    ],
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": [
      "The image is entirely abstract, with no overt or literal reference to femininity, women, or sexuality (aside from the arguably suggestive visual metaphor of awakening/energy).",
      "No branding, text, or specific musical symbols are present, which might make the connection to 'meditation music' less immediately obvious to some viewers."
