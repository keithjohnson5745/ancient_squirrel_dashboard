  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail directly echoes the themes of racial unfairness and social tension in the title, using Michelle Obama's concerned face, a man facing the camera, and a central, ambiguous silhouette against an American backdrop. The highlighted word 'unfair!' connects to the claim of scam/unfair treatment in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail is much broader/simpler in message than the title\u2014the title directly names racism and Michelle Obama's quote, while the thumbnail visually suggests injustice but without explicitly addressing race or quoting her. The central silhouette (suggesting a specific political figure) adds a layer potentially not explicit in the title."
