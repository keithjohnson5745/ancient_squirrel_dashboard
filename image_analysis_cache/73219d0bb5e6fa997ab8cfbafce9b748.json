  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The whiteboard text and the doctor's presence support the idea of a 'comprehensive guide.' The hand-written notes specifically mention NAC (N-Acetylcysteine) and Glutathione, directly matching the video title. The supplement box suggests practical, real-world product ties to the discussion.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title suggests a guide and information about both NAC and Glutathione, but the box prominently features a curcumin-related supplement ('TURMERO', implying turmeric), which might not directly relate to NAC/Glutathione, causing a slight thematic mismatch."
