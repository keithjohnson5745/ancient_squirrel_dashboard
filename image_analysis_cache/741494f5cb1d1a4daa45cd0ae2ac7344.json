  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Both thumbnail and title deliver a strong warning. The thumbnail's bold text and the crossed arms visually emphasize urgency and caution, mirroring the aggressive warning in the title ('9 Haircare Products That Will Destroy Your Hair'). Presenting specific product bottles visually confirms the video is about real, named products. The use of the phrase 'AVOID AT ALL COST!' and the 'X' gesture directly suggest harm or danger, backing up the word 'destroy' in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no major mismatch; if anything, the thumbnail amplifies the sense of danger and consequence suggested in the video title. Both elements work together to increase curiosity and provoke a strong emotional response.",
    "Additional notes": "The thumbnail does not name the products in text, which may prompt viewers to click out of curiosity about which products are being 'exposed.'"
