  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly supports the title by showing healthy foods (implying the '5 foods' mentioned), a scientific/medical metaphor with 'HORMONE BALANCE,' and specifying a focus on women both in the text and by featuring a woman prominently. The urgency and necessity implied in 'WOMEN NEED THIS!' visually reinforces the 'MUST EAT' wording in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not explicitly show a list of five foods; only several food items are presented with no numbering, which could create a mild mismatch for viewers expecting a clear list. However, overall message and visual cues strongly align."
