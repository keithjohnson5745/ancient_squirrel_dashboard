    },
    "Composition type": "Medium shot (subject shown from waist up, turned slightly to the side with head looking toward the camera; occupies the right third of the frame)",
    "Human presence": {
      "Number of people": 1,
      "Expressions": "Neutral to slightly confrontational or confident expression; direct eye contact with viewer",
      "Demographics": "Young adult woman, light skin, dark long hair, wearing dark evening-style dress"
    },
    "Main objects/props featured": "Single woman posing, fitted black dress; no visible props",
    "Background environment": "Solid black background, no environmental details, purely graphic for dramatic effect"
  },
  "TEXT ELEMENTS": {
    "Visible text": "YOU CAN'T BE REPLACED BUT SHE HAS TO LEARN THAT ALONE",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, uppercase serif font, block lettering for high contrast and legibility",
      "Emphasis/colors": {
        "Yellow": "YOU CAN'T",
        "White": "BE REPLACED, TO LEARN THAT",
        "Green": "BUT SHE HAS",

      }
    },
    "Text placement within frame": "Left two-thirds of the thumbnail; centered vertically, stacked in large lines occupying most of the space except where the figure stands on the right",
    "Use of emotional/trigger words": [
      "CAN'T",
      "REPLACED",
      "ALONE"
    ]
  },
  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Intense, dramatic, assertive with undertones of loss/rejection but also empowerment and self-worth",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "The lone woman standing confidently may symbolize independence or 'one of a kind' uniqueness alluded to in the title and text",
    "Clickbait techniques employed": [
      "Use of emotional, bold statements ('YOU CAN'T BE REPLACED')",
      "Direct address that presumes the viewer is personally involved or affected",
      "Contrasting colors and large text for attention",
      "Reference to a mysterious 'she', likely to arouse curiosity"
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit brand logos, but stylistic consistency typical of 'self-improvement' or 'Stoic advice' channels"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail echoes the title's message about value and uniqueness ('You Were One of a Kind\u2026 She Just Didn\u2019t See It') by stating 'YOU CAN'T BE REPLACED BUT SHE HAS TO LEARN THAT ALONE', directly supporting the idea of being irreplaceable and another person's blindness to that fact.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail uses more direct, declarative language than the more reflective/poetic phrasing in the title; the image is somewhat provocative (evening dress, confident pose), which could create a slight mismatch with the philosophical/stoic promise in the video title. However, both are emotionally resonant and focus on uniqueness/self-worth."
