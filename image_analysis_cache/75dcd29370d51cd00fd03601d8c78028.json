  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The person\u2019s enthusiastic pose and smile facing the ocean visually communicates \u2018SURFS UP!\u2019 and the idea of being back in the well-known surfing destination of La Union (\u2018Elyu\u2019). The shimmering water and sunny sky amplify the promise of beach fun found in the video title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no direct visual confirmation of actual surfing (e.g., surfboard or waves), only the implication of being by the ocean in a fun, adventurous context. The text in the thumbnail says 'SURFING IN LA UNION!' instead of specifically stating 'Elyu' or the exact video title."
