  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Both address the subject of a man liking to wear women's panties; thumbnail text restates the main issue in a personal way (\u201cHE LIKES TO WEAR MY PANTIES!\u201d), while the surprised facial expression draws extra attention to the shock/sensational aspect, reinforcing curiosity about reasons or implications (e.g., sexual orientation as in the title).",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not directly reference or question sexual orientation (i.e., 'Is He Gay?'), but presents the situation in a provocative way. The title introduces an explicit question about sexuality, while the thumbnail focuses on the unusual behavior and emotional reaction."
