    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No obvious visual symbols of 'skin' or 'health' in the thumbnail, so the connection to the topic is inferred rather than explicit. The thumbnail depends on the context of a TEDx talk and speaker credibility, rather than direct visual cues related to skin or wellness."
