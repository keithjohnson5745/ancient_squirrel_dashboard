  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses explicit imagery (banana with tape, medical props, and surprised doctor) that directly links to the title '4 Techniques to Make it Hard and Long.' It leverages innuendo and visual metaphor (banana) to allude to male sexual enhancement, echoing the double-meaning, curiosity-driven title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail heavily leans on medical and anatomical imagery while the title subtly uses innuendo, keeping things suggestive rather than explicit. Both are aligned in their attempt to intrigue and promise results, with no major mismatch."
