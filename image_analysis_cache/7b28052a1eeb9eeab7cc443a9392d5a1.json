  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail dramatizes two starkly different ages ('20-year-old' and '40-year-old'), and each scene supposedly shows the same 'daughter' at radically different life stages\u2014directly playing on the concept of someone 'aging' from 1-50. The title suggests visualizing a person's life across decades, which the thumbnail interprets using side-by-side life scenarios.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title covers a wide age range (1-50), but the thumbnail only depicts two specific milestones (age 20, young adult/graduate; and age 40, stressed adult with baby). It does not visually reference ages 1 or 50, nor a full range of ages; instead, it opts for two dramatic life contrasts to grab attention. The concept is reinforced but not fully illustrated."
