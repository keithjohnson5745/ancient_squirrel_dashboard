  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses a peeled banana and shocked/excited expressions to humorously imply the video\u2019s subject about erections and their surprising aspects. The text 'It DOES that?!' echoes the sentiment of the title ('12 Surprising Facts...'), referring to something unexpected about erections, which is reinforced by the banana as a visual innuendo.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no significant mismatch; the innuendo and expressions align with the suggestive, curiosity-driven title. The thumbnail is slightly more implicit, using humor and metaphor, while the title is explicit but still playful. Both work together to maximize intrigue and click-through."
