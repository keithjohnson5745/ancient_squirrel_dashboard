  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly visualizes the title's claim about bizarre or excessive Amazon purchases by showing a comically large amount of colorful, slime-like 'lube' overwhelming both the person and the recognizable Amazon packaging. This literalizes the absurdity implied in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The title uses the shocking and humorous phrase, '500lbs of LUBE!,' while the thumbnail uses colorful slime to represent 'lube,' making it more visually appealing and family-friendly than the potentially risqu\u00e9 literal interpretation, which is suitable for a broader YouTube audience."
