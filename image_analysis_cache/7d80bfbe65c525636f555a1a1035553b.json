  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail emphasizes meeting and showcasing 'amateur porn couples' by featuring several presumably real couples in friendly, candid photos. The expressions and groupings support the idea of being curious about or directly engaging with these individuals, matching the tone of the channel name 'Come Curious.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Thumbnail focuses on the idea of 'meeting' people rather than the explicit act referenced in the full video title ('Why people have SEX on camera!'). The word 'SEX' is absent from the thumbnail itself, likely as a strategy for both algorithmic safety and broader click appeal. The thumbnail\u2019s friendly tone downplays any potentially provocative or adult content suggested by the title, instead focusing on humanizing the subjects."
