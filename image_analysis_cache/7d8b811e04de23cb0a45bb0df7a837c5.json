  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The medium close-up shot directly spotlights the subject of the story, personalizing the unusual and medically complex subject described in the title. The text 'I didn\u2019t feel disabled enough' alludes to internal struggles and connects emotionally to the idea of having a rare condition (as spelled out in the video title). The LISTEN UP series logo indicates this is a personal narrative.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail does not mention or visually reference the specifics of her condition ('two vaginas, two uteruses and two cervixes'), focusing instead on her emotional perspective about disability. This creates a sense of mystery and encourages viewers to click to hear the full story, but may also be intentionally vague to attract a broader audience."
