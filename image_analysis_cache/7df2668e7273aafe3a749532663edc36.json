  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly mirrors the video title's central topic (oily skin) by stating 'WHY YOU LOOK OILY' and having the person point at their face, emphasizing skin appearance. The inquisitive emoji in the title (\ud83e\udd14) aligns with the questioning style of the thumbnail.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail says 'WHY YOU LOOK OILY' while the title says 'WHY YOU HAVE OILY SKIN'; the meaning is very similar but the thumbnail's wording focuses on visible appearance rather than underlying causes. The thumbnail omits 'DERMATOLOGIST @DrDrayzday,' but the presence of a knowledgeable-looking individual in a clean, clinical visual style implies expertise."
