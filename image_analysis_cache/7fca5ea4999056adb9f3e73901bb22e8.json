  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The stark visual contrast between the elegant, poised old-fashioned masculine figure ('THEN') and the aggressive, hyper-muscular, shirtless modern figure ('NOW') directly illustrates the video's premise of a 'scary shift in masculinity.' Both the visual and the title suggest an alarming or negative transformation over time.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatch. The thumbnail effectively parallels and enhances the video's title by making the generational and stylistic shift in masculinity immediately apparent and framing it as something 'scary' or concerning."
