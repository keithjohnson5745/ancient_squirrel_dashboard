    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No apparent mismatches\u2014the visual and textual cues all point directly to fertility, medical awareness, and age-relevant concerns. The only slight contrast might be the word 'mistakes' which is more general than 'infertility', but contextually it supports the message of prevention and awareness."
