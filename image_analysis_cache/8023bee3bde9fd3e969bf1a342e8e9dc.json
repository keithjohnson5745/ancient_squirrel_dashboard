  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

The title refers to \u2018lock snapping\u2019 but the thumbnail itself does not visually depict snapping or forced entry, only the process of changing a lock. However, the person\u2019s concerned expression and the direct call to \u2018WHY YOU SHOULD!\u2019 imply an important underlying reason, indirectly reinforcing the security threat addressed in the video title."
