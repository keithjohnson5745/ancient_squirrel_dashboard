    "Overall emotional tone": "Serious, investigative, possibly cautionary. The mood is heightened by privacy of subjects and the focus on petroleum jelly in a medical/DIY context.",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [

      "Dramatic split composition (juxtaposing people with a mysterious substance/preparation)",

  "4. THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Left side shows the group of men, alluding to 'mga mister' mentioned in the title. The right side features a close-up of petroleum jelly prepared over a flame, directly referencing the act of injecting it ('nagpaturok ng petroleum jelly sa kanilang ari'). The show's branding reassures viewers this will be handled by a reputable investigative team.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches; the visual directly supports the subject matter in the title. The only indirect aspect is that the act of injection is not shown (for propriety), but the implication is very clear and strongly themed."
