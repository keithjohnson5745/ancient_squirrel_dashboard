  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually represents the medical connection mentioned in the title by combining a man (likely a medical expert), a specific highlighted area on an anatomical image (the SI joint), and a nerve path (sciatica). The text directly repeats the two key terms from the title (SCIATICA and SI JOINT).",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatches; the thumbnail is highly aligned with the title. The highlighted area and the visible nerve path together visually underline the 'connection' alluded to in the title."
