  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly visualizes 'first trimester' through the pregnant figure, while the icons quickly communicate 'tips' and 'do\u2019s/don\u2019ts' matching the promise of 'everything you need to know.' The presence of a doctor-like figure connects with 'from a fertility doctor' in the title.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The thumbnail does not visually specify 'doctor' credentials (no lab coat, stethoscope, or name badge), but the professional appearance and tone are consistent with medical expertise. The word 'everything' from the title is broader than what the thumbnail alone suggests (which implies select actionable tips)."
