The inclusion of both a real person (presumed expert/host) and an expectant mother graphic visually represents the target audience and outcome.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches. The thumbnail simplifies the content to 'GET PREGNANT ON THESE DAYS' which is broader/more sensational than the more nuanced 'Best Time to Conceive & Ovulation Tips' in the title, but this enhances click appeal. There are no explicit references to ovulation in the thumbnail imagery or text."
