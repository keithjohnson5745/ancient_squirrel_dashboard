The presence of a medical professional adds credibility and promises expertise, matching the instructional/authoritative implication of the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong alignment; the only subtle area is the heavy use of clickbait visual metaphors (bananas) versus the likely more clinical discussion in the video. The textual claim about increasing 'size' goes beyond just correct massage technique, hinting at transformative results, which might exaggerate the actual video content."
