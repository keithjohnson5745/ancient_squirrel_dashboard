  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "Thumbnail directly visualizes the title by highlighting supplements to avoid, explicitly stating 'DON'T TAKE THIS SUPPLEMENTS IF YOU'RE TTC,' matching the video's warning theme about fertility supplements. The inclusion of a supplement bottle and the emphasis on 'SUPPLEMENTS' further cements the topic.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail text is direct and matches the urgency and topic of the video title. There is no notable mismatch; 'TTC' is slightly more jargon-heavy versus the more explicit 'get pregnant fast' phrasing in the title, but both target the same audience."
