  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail leans into the tech and podcast concept (microphone with sound lines, modern fonts, 'ASCENDARA' branding), supporting the educational nature of the title and signaling a technology/business-oriented discussion.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The thumbnail text titles the episode as 'HR Tech Unplugged: The Future of Digitized Workplaces,' which is slightly broader and less specific than the YouTube video title focusing on 'Digitization vs. Digitalization vs. Transformation'; the thumbnail misses a direct visual or textual cue about 'digitization vs. digitalization vs. transformation.'",
    "Summary": "The visual design supports a branded, professional, and tech-focused podcast atmosphere but does not explicitly illustrate or define the three HR transformation concepts mentioned in the video title."
