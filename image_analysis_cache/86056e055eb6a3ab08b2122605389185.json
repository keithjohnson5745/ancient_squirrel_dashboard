    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title mentions 'Top 40 Rock Songs,' but the thumbnail only says 'Best of 90s Rock Music,' omitting the specificity of 'Top 40.' The video may be about a playlist or compilation, but this isn't visually referenced; no song names, bands, or numbers are included."
