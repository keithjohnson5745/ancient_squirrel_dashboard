  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly references the subject of sexual reproduction in animals by showing two giraffes in a suggestive posture with the bold text 'ANIMAL SEX', matching the provocative/educational tone of the video title ('Sexual & Asexual Reproduction: How Animals Do It'). The use of cartoon imagery and hearts keeps the tone light and suitable for an educational audience.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail focuses only on sexual reproduction and does not reference asexual reproduction, which is also included in the video title. The somewhat playful, cartoonish design contrasts with the full scientific scope implied by the title but does not create direct misunderstanding."
