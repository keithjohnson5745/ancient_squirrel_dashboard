  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by featuring the large, highlighted word 'STD' (acronym for sexually transmitted diseases), and referencing common types ('Bacterial, Viral, Parasitic'), which aligns with the specific diseases listed in the title (HPV, HIV, Gonorrhea, Syphilis). The medical props and professional appearance of the speaker further reinforce the health/educational topic.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The thumbnail uses only the general term 'STD' and the three main categories, not directly naming the specific diseases (HPV, HIV, Gonorrhea, Syphilis) found in the title. However, this broad approach helps maintain clarity and visual impact for a potentially wide audience, sacrificing some specificity."
