  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": [
      "The thumbnail visually depicts Durex lubricant being dispensed, which directly matches the video title promising a 'Durex lubricants review' and the descriptive adjectives used.",
      "The use of #shorts in the title matches the vertical video format seen in the thumbnail."
    ],
    "Contrasts/mismatches": [
      "The title uses emotional/positive language ('amazing product'), but the thumbnail itself is matter-of-fact and does not visually emphasize excitement or strong emotion.",
      "No clear emphasis on the 'review' aspect, as it just shows product use, not any comparison or rating."
