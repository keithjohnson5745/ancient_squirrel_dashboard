  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail depicts a variety of chain lubes (and one unconventional option\u2014PAM cooking spray) in a lineup, suggesting a head-to-head comparison. This visually matches the title's promise of a 'Comparison Test' and the provocative question about never buying chain lube again, implying the inclusion of an alternative household product.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no clear contradiction; rather, the inclusion of PAM is itself a visual 'twist' that amplifies curiosity and fits the title\u2019s premise. The thumbnail doesn't show any human or explicit testing action, which might contrast with expectations of a test in progress, but the spray effect hints at active experimentation."
