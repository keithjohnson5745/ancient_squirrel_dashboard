  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows the exact act of face shaving (dermaplaning) featured in the video title. The use of a close-up shot makes the skin and razor clearly visible, signaling that this is a personal, at-home skincare routine as referenced in the title. 'Japanese Method' text ties in with the idea of specialized technique or cultural method.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail aligns well with the title; however, it visually emphasizes the 'shaving' action more than the broader 'pre/post care' routine mentioned in the title. The word 'skincare' in the title is mildly underrepresented visually, as the main focus is on the act of shaving rather than the routine as a whole."
