  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title by showing a pregnant belly and baby shoes (directly tied to getting pregnant) and placing bold text that repeats the title's keywords ('3', 'Natural', 'Fertility Boosters'). The presence of a smiling woman lends credibility and approachability, potentially representing the video's host or expert.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no major mismatch; however, while the title suggests advice for getting pregnant quickly, the image of an already pregnant belly reflects the end goal rather than the process. The natural boosters themselves aren't visually indicated, so the cause-effect relationship is implied rather than demonstrated."
