  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features the central figure (presumably the video creator), smiling and engaging, putting a human face to the 'journey' described in the title. The large text 'TTC JOURNEY' directly references the video topic (Trying To Conceive), while the illustrated baby visually supports the idea of pregnancy and success ('How I Got Pregnant'). The additional text 'Tips + Early Symptoms' hints at the practical information to be delivered, matching the promise in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant contrast or mismatch. Both thumbnail and title are closely aligned, with both focusing on conception success and helpful advice. The title emphasizes speed ('on the FIRST try'), which is not visually referenced in the thumbnail, but this is a subtle omission rather than a contradiction."
