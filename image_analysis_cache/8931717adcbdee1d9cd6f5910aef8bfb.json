    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail uses a direct, scientific visual (embryo/cell) that connects strongly to the subject of fertility, reproduction, and conception, reinforcing the video title's focus on fertility solutions for couples struggling to conceive.",

The connection to the title relies on viewers recognizing the embryo/cell as related to fertility, rather than seeing products or people."
