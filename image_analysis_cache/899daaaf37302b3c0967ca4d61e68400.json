  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Title references 'The Science of Women\u2019s Health' and '10 Truths You Need to Know,' while the thumbnail's text ('THEY'RE LYING TO YOU') suggests misinformation and the unveiling of hidden facts. The presence of a guest labeled as an Ob/Gyn visually confirms the medical/health focus. The serious and intense facial expressions fit the idea of revealing uncomfortable truths.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail emphasizes deception and urgency ('LYING'), which is more sensational than the relatively informative and scientific framing of the title. The thumbnail is designed for maximum emotional impact, whereas the title leans toward educational content."
