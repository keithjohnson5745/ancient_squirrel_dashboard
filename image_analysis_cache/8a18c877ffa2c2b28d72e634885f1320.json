  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual Reinforcement": "Thumbnail visually echoes the title by showing garlic (explicitly two cloves pointed out), which matches '\u0932\u0939\u0938\u0941\u0928 \u0915\u0940 \u0926\u094b \u0915\u0932\u093f\u092f\u093e\u0902 \u0915\u0930 \u0926\u0947\u0924\u0940 \u0939\u0948 \u0915\u092e\u093e\u0932.' The cartoon banana and smiling host further attract curiosity about what 'amazing' effect is being referred to, tying into the promise/hint in both Hindi and English text. The English 'USE IN NIGHT' ties into the title's sense of advice or warning.",
    "Contrasts or Mismatches": "Thumbnail is visually playful (smiling banana), which is less serious than the warning/medicinal tone implied in the title portion '\u092f\u0939 \u0932\u094b\u0917 \u0932\u0939\u0938\u0941\u0928 \u0915\u092d\u0940 \u092d\u0940 \u0928\u093e \u0916\u093e\u090f\u0902.' There is no explicit warning in the visual\u2014only promise of benefit (not risk)\u2014so it mostly supports the informational/benefit angle, not the cautionary aspect."
