  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "Thumbnail visually supports the title by showing both a confident, professional-looking woman (doctor/expert) and a woman appearing calm and relieved (potential 'patient'), directly tying to the video's apparent goal of providing medical advice/relief.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a strong match between thumbnail and title; both emphasize a practical solution and professional expertise. Potential minor mismatch could stem from the relaxed posture of the center woman (suggestive/aspirational) versus the explicit, somewhat clinical problem stated in the title, but this is typical for health content."
