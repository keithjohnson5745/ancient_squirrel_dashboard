  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The left panel shows a large protest scene with \u2018STOP TRUMP!\u2019 sign, directly supporting the idea of a \u2018No Kings\u2019 protest against Trump. The center (anchor) adds news authority, while the right panel (Trump) shows the subject of the protest and parade. The triad format illustrates the conflict central to the video\u2019s premise.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses \u2018STOP TRUMP!\u2019 sign, not the phrase \u2018No Kings,\u2019 creating a slight disconnect with the exact protest branding from the title. The military aspect is implied by Trump\u2019s presence and public protest, but not directly depicted."
