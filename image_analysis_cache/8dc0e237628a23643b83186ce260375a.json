  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail visually captures the theme of a high-stakes first meeting/conflict ('First faceoff') between two key figures (implied as Carney and Trump). The Oval Office background situates the issue in a US political context, matching the Canada-U.S. trade war storyline. The prominent placement and serious demeanor of both figures reinforce the anticipation of a confrontation or negotiation.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatch; the thumbnail directly illustrates the idea of a key Canada-U.S. confrontation in a recognizable setting (Oval Office) as implied by the title. The only possible minor contrast: the title refers directly to the 'trade war' with 'Trump', but the thumbnail uses the more dramatic but vaguer phrase 'First faceoff', which is more emotionally charged and less specific than 'trade war'."
