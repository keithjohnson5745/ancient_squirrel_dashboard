  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features bold text emphasizing the irresistible nature of certain women and the act of 'disconnecting,' which echoes the video's theme.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text uses 'DISCONNECT' while the title uses 'Break Away,' which are similar in meaning but not identical; otherwise, the elements are highly consistent. The image of an older male intellectual may not visually suggest women or relationships directly, but it reinforces the idea of analysis or authority."
