  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The banana as a phallic stand-in directly references the sexual topic.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major conflicts, though the thumbnail is more comical and suggestive compared to the title\u2019s clinical tone. It relies on innuendo and humor, while the title is direct and instructional."
