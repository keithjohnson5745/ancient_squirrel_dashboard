  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title ('Music for Work \u2014 Deep Focus Mix for Programming, Coding') by showing an individual deeply engaged or lost in thought in a high-tech, vibrant environment. The lighting and focus cues (blurred background, crisp face) evoke concentration and immersion, matching the 'focus' theme promised in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No direct coding imagery (e.g., code or laptops) is shown, so the relation to 'programming/coding' is implied via the digital environment and not explicit\u2014but the techy background and focus on a single individual do fit the work/concentration vibe overall."
