      "Number of people": 2,
      "Expressions": [
        "The woman: neutral, before-and-after face (left side shows more wrinkles, right side appears smoother)",
        "The man: animated/excited, mouth slightly open as if explaining or reacting, hand pointing upward"
      ],
      "Demographics": [

    "Brand elements present": "No overt branding or logos visible in the thumbnail itself"
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly communicates the video's claim by showing a dramatic facial transformation (before-and-after) with 'REVERSES AGE' written boldly. The scoop of powder and the pointing person suggest a single supplement is responsible, tying into 'The Single Best Supplement To Never Age.'",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There are no obvious mismatches; the thumbnail and title strongly support each other. However, the term 'never age' is slightly contrasted by the text 'reverses age' in the thumbnail, but both communicate dramatic anti-aging promises."
