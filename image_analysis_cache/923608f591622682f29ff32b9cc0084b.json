  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail\u2019s text ('My First Sex Party', 'EPISODE 60', 'EXCLUSIVE') directly relates to the podcast episode\u2019s content as described in the title. The surprised and cheeky expressions of the hosts visually mirror the suggestive and bold nature of the title ('A Guide To... S3x Parties'). Use of sexualized attire and explicit language (with censorship) in the graphics amplifies the connection to the topic.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment: both are open and explicit yet maintain a playful approach rather than a clinical or purely sensational one. The spelling 'S3x' (censored) is slightly different in the title compared to the plain language in the thumbnail ('Sex'), but overall the visual and textual messaging are consistent."
