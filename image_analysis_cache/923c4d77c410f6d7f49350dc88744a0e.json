  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a person in what appears to be a pharmacy or shop setting, suggesting expertise and a context related to products/medicines, which is relevant to the topic of vaginal lubricants. The instructional posture of the speaker also aligns with the educational intent indicated by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no explicit visual reference to vaginal lubricants in the thumbnail (e.g., no lubricant bottles or packaging highlighted), and none of the visible product labels clearly relate to the subject. The connection is indirect and relies on the assumed expertise of the person in the setting rather than direct visual cues."
