The 'Step by Step Guide' text reinforces the instructional/educational purpose.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not explicitly mention 'Vaginal Tightening' or 'Pelvic Floor Exercises,' though 'Kegel Exercises' implies this. However, the directness and simplicity are likely intentional for wider comfort and share-ability. There is a minor omission of the specifics from the title, but overall, the message is strongly aligned."
