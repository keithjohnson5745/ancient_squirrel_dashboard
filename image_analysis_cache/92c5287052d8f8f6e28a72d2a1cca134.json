    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant contrasts. The thumbnail cleanly matches the title content and intent. Both use soft, friendly imagery while presenting a direct, potentially sensitive topic in a straightforward, solution-based way. Potential mismatch only in the sense that the thumbnail\u2019s tone is gentle, while the subject matter may evoke discomfort, but this is balanced intentionally to increase approachability."
