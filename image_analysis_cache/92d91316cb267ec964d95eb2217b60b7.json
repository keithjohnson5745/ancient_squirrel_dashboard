  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features a direct excerpt of the likely question addressed in the video (about first time anal sex, echoing 'Tips for First Time Anal Sex' in the title). The presence of a urologist/expert (indicated by the person, her name, 'MD') and the playful metaphor visually reinforce the sex-ed/medical focus, matching the explanatory and prevention themes in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail emphasizes the question 'My BF wants anal sex, what should I do?' which personalizes and sensationalizes the title's educational angle. It does not mention prostate cancer or after-dribble (latter parts of title), focusing fully on the advice-for-anal-sex angle."
