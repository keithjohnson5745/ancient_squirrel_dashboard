  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail's large chalkboard question directly references and visually echoes the key question in the video title. The presence of a confident host and clean, 'lesson-like' setup supports the educational premise suggested by 'Lube 101.'",

The thumbnail does not visually reference condoms or lubricant types specifically, relying on text and implication instead of imagery."
