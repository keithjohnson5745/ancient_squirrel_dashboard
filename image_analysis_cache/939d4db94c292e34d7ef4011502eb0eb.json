  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual focus on the garage door (main subject of the video title) and the red arrow pointing to a part of it directly connects to the subject of lubrication/maintenance. The phrase 'DON'T FORGET' reinforces the idea that maintenance (i.e., lubricating squeaky doors) is important and commonly forgotten.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There\u2019s no visible lubricant, tools, or explicit depiction of lubrication in the thumbnail, only the suggestion that something important must be done to the door. However, the link is clear given the context, though some viewers may expect a more concrete visual cue related to lubricants."
