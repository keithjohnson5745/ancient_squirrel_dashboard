  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail visually contrasts single-phase and three-phase transformer utility poles, directly relating to the video's educational theme of 'How 3 Phase Transformers Work' and 'why we need them.' The correct and incorrect voltages for each system clarify their functional differences, previewing an explanation from the video.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches. The thumbnail is highly aligned with the title and uses visual cues to cue the viewer in to the key distinction (the necessity and advantage of three-phase systems)."
