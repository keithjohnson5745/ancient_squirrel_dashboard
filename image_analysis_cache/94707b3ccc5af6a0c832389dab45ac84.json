  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail illustrates the core of the title by showing the India-Pakistan border, national flags, jets being deployed near the border, one man looking worried (interpreted as Pakistani side), and another man issuing a warning (possibly the presenter). The text 'BIG ALERT FOR PAKISTAN' visually and verbally amplifies the crisis described in the video title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail visually matches the alarmist language of the title, with no significant mismatch. However, the scale of aircraft and intensity of emotion are somewhat exaggerated for dramatic/clickbait effect beyond what a real news photo would show."
