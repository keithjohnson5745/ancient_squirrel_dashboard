  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows multiple commercial airplanes and an airport, directly referencing the aviation theme and setting for the air traffic control incident described in the title.",

The tension in the title is not directly reflected in the visual content, which appears orderly and routine."
