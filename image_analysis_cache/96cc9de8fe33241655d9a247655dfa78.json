  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows two people directly engaging with Rubik\u2019s cubes, visibly counted and separated in front of each. The stack and count of cubes directly answer and illustrate the video\u2019s challenge posed by the title ('how many cubes can I solve VS my student?'). Money adds visible stakes, indicating competition or reward. Profile icons and cube graphics above their heads reinforce the head-to-head format, matching 'VS' language in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches; the thumbnail clearly aligns with the competitive, quantified challenge presented in the video title. The only possible mismatch is that 'student' status is not explicitly clear from just the image, but the competition context is clear."
