  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual of a woman evaluating a group of differently-styled men directly ties into the theme of 'who you're attracted to.' Use of the word 'CHANGES' in red, along with the varied presentation of men, visually reinforces the idea that birth control can alter attraction preferences \u2014 pivoting perfectly off the title's promise to explore 'Your Brain on Birth Control.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail accurately matches the title; both address the change in attraction linked to birth control. The cartoon tone is slightly lighter and more playful than the scientific/medical expectation the title may imply, but this likely serves to make the topic more approachable."
