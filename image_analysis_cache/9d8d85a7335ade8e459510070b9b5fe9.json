  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The presence of US military personnel in an arctic setting directly supports the subject of potential US military action in Greenland. Trump's prominent face connects the idea of a decision or plan authored by him, while the critical language visually links to the judgment in the title ('seize Greenland if Trump forced them').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches\u2014both are strongly aligned in tone and subject. The word 'stupid' is a value judgment not stated in the title, making the thumbnail visually more provocative than the more neutral/analytical phrasing of the title."
