    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "no explicit visual metaphors; use of quotation marks and euphemism ('Down There') acts as a visual and verbal cue for a sensitive topic",

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail's text directly references the pain ('IT HURTS \"DOWN THERE\"!!') described in the video title and visually underscores the sensitive, intimate nature of the topic with a euphemism, making the content approachable. The term 'UROGENITAL ATROPHY' in the thumbnail also directly connects with the medical focus of the title ('Vaginal atrophy'). The friendly, approachable photo helps counterbalance the potential embarrassment or discomfort of the subject.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a minor contrast between the upbeat facial expression (smiling woman) and the topic of pain/discomfort, but this may be intentional to put viewers at ease. The actual explicit medical term 'vaginal atrophy' from the title is only partially echoed in the thumbnail ('urogenital atrophy')\u2014the latter is broader but still relevant."
