    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a minor contrast in that the title specifically references Knicks and Celtics and uses the word 'dumbest', while the thumbnail singles out the Celtics and focuses more on historical failure and the general 'badness' of the game, possibly not specifying the 'dumb' aspect as clearly."
