  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail clearly shows popular lock/lubrication products with a 'do not use' symbol. This suggests the video will address 'fixing and lubricating a sticky lock and key' but possibly advises against using these common products\u2014aligning with the idea of finding the correct solution.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No clear mismatch; rather, the thumbnail adds intrigue by implying that commonly suggested products are NOT the best option, which complements the educational nature promised by the title."
