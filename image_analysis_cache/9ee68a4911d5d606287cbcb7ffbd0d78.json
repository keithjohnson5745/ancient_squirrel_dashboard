      "expressions/demographics": "No face shown, focus on body; appears young adult, light skin tone, long hair visible on the right."

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly demonstrates the video's core claim: that a change in approach led to physical transformation. The strong 'before/after' visual echoes the video\u2019s discussion on fitness mistakes and real results, supporting the 'here\u2019s how I ACTUALLY got fit' of the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No overt mismatch\u2014both focus on dispelling myths or previous mistakes, revealing something unexpected about true transformation. However, the thumbnail\u2019s text ('what actually changed my body') is generic and does not directly echo the title's provocative claim that 'fitness made me fat'. This could slightly downplay the controversy suggested in the title."
