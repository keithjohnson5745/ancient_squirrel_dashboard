  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "There is no clear visual connection. The title ('Pijpen en beffen' \u2014 Dutch slang referencing explicit sexual activities) is provocative, while the thumbnail shows a mundane, empty city street with no apparent connection to the topic.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong contrast: the title is highly suggestive and sexual in nature, whereas the thumbnail is ordinary, neutral, and non-sexual. This may be intentional to provoke curiosity or mislead, commonly seen in clickbait tactics."
