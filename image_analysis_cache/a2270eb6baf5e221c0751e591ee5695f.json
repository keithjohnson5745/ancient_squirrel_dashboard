  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail shows a medical professional in front of a detailed whiteboard, clearly emphasizing an educational breakdown about collagen supplements \u2014 exactly what the title promises ('what you need to know before starting'). The direct, somewhat cautionary tone of the board's heading directly supports the title's focus on essential pre-knowledge.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title uses animal emojis (pig, cow, fish, egg) to highlight the sources or types of collagen, while the thumbnail board only briefly references sources (e.g., 'fish derived,' 'bone broth,' 'chicken,' 'egg') and does not include those visual emojis/animals, so the playful/graphic aspect of the title is less visually reinforced."
