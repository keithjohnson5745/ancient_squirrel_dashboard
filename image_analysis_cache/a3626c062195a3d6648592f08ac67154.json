  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail echoes the title directly: it shows a (presumed) Rachel Zegler crying (matching 'demands' and 'humiliated' wording), and South Park's Snow White (parody/representation) also crying, implying a strong emotional reaction to the episode. The use of an Instagram Live overlay implies a public, real-time outcry, fitting the 'demands' and social backlash elements implied in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No glaring mismatches, but the thumbnail visually exaggerates the emotional distress (multiple depictions of crying, repeated visual cues) as a clear clickbait escalation. This is a common technique to amplify perceived outrage or controversy for views."
