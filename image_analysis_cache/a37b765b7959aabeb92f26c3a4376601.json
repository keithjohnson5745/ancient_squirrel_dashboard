  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

The word 'Skyrocket!' matches exactly between thumbnail and title, amplifying the message.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail visually narrows the focus to 'cost of living' skyrocketing without direct reference to 'America collapsing', which is part of the video title; however, the implied anxiety is consistent in both."
