    "Reinforcement": "The visual focuses on a product or tool directly manipulated, which aligns with a tutorial/instructional video implied by a title like 'How to get PREGNANT FAST'\u2014suggesting a solution or hack.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There are no explicit pregnancy or fertility symbols (like pregnancy tests, babies, or medical diagrams), so the thumbnail relies on context and may confuse viewers unfamiliar with the product. The image is clinical and non-emotive, while the title is bold and solution-oriented."
