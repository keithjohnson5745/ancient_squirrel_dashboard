  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The visual of a skeptical woman holding coffee, the focus on caffeine molecules, and warning/cautious emojis directly reference both 'caffeine risk' and 'fertility,' aligning perfectly with the video's topic. The scientific representation (molecule) echoes 'evidence and guidelines' in the title. The use of a question ('HOW MUCH IS TOO MUCH!?!') teases the informational content about risk thresholds.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment; both focus on caffeine and risk. The only slight mismatch might be that the thumbnail is less explicitly medical or guideline-based\u2014leaning more on visual drama and concern, but overall it is a good match for the video title."
