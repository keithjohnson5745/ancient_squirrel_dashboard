  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail prominently shows the medication (both the blister pack and product box) as well as a medical professional, matching the title's focus on 'Tadalafil' and its use (including the specific mention of 'Intimate 10mg'). Text in both English and Bengali targets a bilingual audience, aligning with the video's likely demographic. The inclusion of 'Side Effect' matches the title's educational angle.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The thumbnail does not directly reference 'Vigorex' or the comparison aspect mentioned at the end of the title (Intimate vs Vigorex), nor does it visually hint at different medicines being compared. Main focus is on Intimate 10mg and Tadalafil explanation, not on product comparison or alternatives, which may slightly underdeliver on the full promise of the title."
