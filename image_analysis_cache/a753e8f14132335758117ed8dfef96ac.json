  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail\u2019s use of bold text (\u2018MAXIMUM PENETRATION POSITION\u2019) directly echoes the sexual/educational theme of the title \u2018Deep Penetration with the \u201cProng\u201d Position: A Guide to Pleasure\u2019. The shocked face visually cues the viewer to expect something intense or surprising, aligning with the subject matter of the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail is somewhat generic in that it does not reference the 'Prong' position specifically and relies heavily on text and facial expression for intrigue, rather than contextual imagery related to sexual education or positions. The emoji from the title (\ud83c\udf1f) is not visually present."
