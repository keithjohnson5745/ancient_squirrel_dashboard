  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail text uses first-person language ('I Cured My Autoimmune Disease'), matching the title\u2019s focus on a doctor revealing her healing journey. The close-up of a woman (presumed to be Dr. Cynthia Li) and the singular, bold emphasis on 'Disease' visually communicate personal experience and breakthrough\u2014themes directly expressed in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail simplifies the title to a bold first-person statement, omitting the hosts' names and the conversational aspect suggested by the full title. The simplified message may amplify curiosity and emotional impact compared to the more informational, interview-style video title."
