    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail focuses almost exclusively on 'masturbation' and its negative impact, whereas the title covers broader topics (infertility, porn, andropause). This is a narrowing for clickbait/engagement purposes; other title subjects are not visually referenced."
