  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail graphically represents a \u2018war\u2019 for whales by showing a threatening harpoon held by a stern figure opposite a prominent whale, echoing the title's promise of revealing underlying conflict. The inclusion of the presenter reinforces the 'inside'/expos\u00e9 angle.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No overt mismatch; both communicate tension and conflict over whales. The thumbnail dramatizes the implied \u2018war,\u2019 which may be slightly exaggerated visually (with the weapon and mood) compared to a possibly more nuanced real-world conflict, but aligns strongly overall with the title\u2019s intent."
