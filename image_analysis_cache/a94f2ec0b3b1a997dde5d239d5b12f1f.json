  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The title hints at supernatural suspense ('CID officer', '\u0906\u0924\u094d\u092e\u093e' [spirit/ghost]), while the shocked, staring faces of the characters in the thumbnail strongly imply they are witnessing something frightening or mysterious. The group\u2019s focused attention and dramatic body language match the theme of investigating the unknown, heightening curiosity about whose life is in danger.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no explicit visual of a ghost or supernatural entity; the tension is implied solely through human reaction rather than direct imagery of the 'spirit.' The thumbnail focuses more on the ensemble's reaction than giving an explicit clue about which officer is affected, matching the title's mystery but not directly visualizing its supernatural promise."
