  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features Pete Buttigieg, who is named in the title, directly relating the visual to the topic promised.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no fox, family, or visible 'attack' scenario depicted in the thumbnail, nor any instant reaction shots. The image alone does not visually communicate the supposed confrontation or dramatic turn suggested by the title. The thumbnail relies on recognition of Pete Buttigieg and the viewer\u2019s curiosity sparked by the title."
