  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail shows three individuals with visibly emotional facial expressions, which visually supports the title\u2019s suggestion of conflict or anger (\"Karla Estrada, nagalit nga ba sa amin? | Ogie Diaz\"). The large, direct quote in the thumbnail text (\u2018Why are you targeting Daniel?\u2019) connects explicitly to the video's narrative of accusation or anger.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is little contrast or mismatch; both the thumbnail and title focus on alleged anger or confrontation involving Karla Estrada, and both reference a conflict around someone named Daniel. The thumbnail\u2019s direct, in-your-face text amplifies the curiosity prompted by the slightly more reserved title."
