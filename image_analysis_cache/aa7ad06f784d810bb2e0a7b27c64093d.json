  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatch; both focus on the same topic. However, the thumbnail wording is slightly more urgency- and solution-focused ('How to treat') than the more nuanced, educational phrasing ('Managing ...Tips and Treatment Options') in the title. The thumbnail is visually stronger on problem/solution, while the title hints at a more comprehensive, gentle approach."
