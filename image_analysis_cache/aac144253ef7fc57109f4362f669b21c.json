      "'Episode 69' in the thumbnail matches the sexual undertones of the title, further reinforcing the playful, explicit nature."
    ],
    "Contrasts or mismatches": [
      "The thumbnail is more playful and visually clean than the outright explicit detail of the title ('BJs', 'Butt Holes', 'Break Ups'), which are avoided in visible thumbnail text for platform-appropriateness.",
      "Thumbnail focuses more on personalities/reactions than directly on specific topics listed in the title."
