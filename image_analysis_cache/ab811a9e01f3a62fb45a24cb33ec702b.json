The imagery makes it immediately clear that the content is practical and instructional.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts or mismatches. The title adds an emotional motivator ('Don\u2019t Get Locked Out \ud83d\udd11'), which is only indirectly referenced in the thumbnail via the locked car imagery\u2014the urgency is more implied than visually explicit."
