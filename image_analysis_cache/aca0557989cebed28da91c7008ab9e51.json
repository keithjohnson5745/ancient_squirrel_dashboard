  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail heavily supports the title by focusing on both health ('Repairs Stem Cells') and medical expertise (image of Dr. William Li, named in both thumbnail and title). Use of bold/emphatic language corresponds to the title's promise of powerful food hacks with healing and fat-burning properties.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail simplifies the title's comprehensive message (multiple food hacks, burning fat, starving cancer) to a single, dramatic health claim ('Repairs Stem Cells'), which may lead to expectations of a miracle food rather than a nuanced discussion. This is a common clickbait approach."
