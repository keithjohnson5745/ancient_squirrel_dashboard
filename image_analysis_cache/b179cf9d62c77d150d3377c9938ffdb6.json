    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail clearly shows a practical demonstration involving a tampon and what appears to be a simulation with a bottle, aligning well with the educational and explanatory promises of 'how to use a tampon'. The visible reaction from the male participant and the comedic caption suggest the content will include relatable, possibly gender-dynamic humor about menstruation tips.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no major contrast; however, the use of a male participant's reaction as a focal point and the comedic caption add an extra layer of humor not explicitly suggested by the educational tone of the title. The title promises tips; the thumbnail suggests both demonstration and comedic reactions."
