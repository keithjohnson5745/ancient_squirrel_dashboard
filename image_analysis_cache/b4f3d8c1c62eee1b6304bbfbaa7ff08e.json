    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The title mentions both 'Do's and Don'ts' and the specific expert name, whereas the thumbnail simplifies this to a positive, actionable message without the expert's name or mention of 'Do's and Don'ts.' The thumbnail focuses on approachability, positivity, and simplicity rather than technical or clinical aspects."
