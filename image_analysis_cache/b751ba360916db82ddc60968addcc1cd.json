  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features a woman presenting as a medical professional (stethoscope, office/clinic setting), matching the educational/advisory topic indicated by the title about lubricant use for anal sex. The professional visual aims to lend authority and reassurance to a potentially sensitive topic.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a contrast between the very clinical, professional appearance of the thumbnail and the explicit, sexual nature of the title. The thumbnail avoids sensationalism, which may build trust but could be less attention-grabbing than more provocative imagery. No visual lubricant products, text, or sex-related imagery are present\u2014relying solely on the trust conferred by the medical professional."
