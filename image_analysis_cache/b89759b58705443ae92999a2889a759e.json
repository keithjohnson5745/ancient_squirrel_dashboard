  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title 'Solving my BIGGEST fear\u2026' by depicting a large, complex puzzle (a clear metaphor for a 'big fear') and a tired\u2014but possibly accomplished\u2014person next to it. The text 'We did it..' suggests a struggle has been overcome, directly tying back to the idea of conquering a major fear or challenge.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "While the title suggests a high-emotion, dramatic achievement, the person's expression is more subdued/exhausted than celebratory, which may generate curiosity (why aren\u2019t they happier? Was it really that difficult?). The word 'BIGGEST' in the title is not visually echoed in the image, though the size and complexity of the puzzle hint at it."
