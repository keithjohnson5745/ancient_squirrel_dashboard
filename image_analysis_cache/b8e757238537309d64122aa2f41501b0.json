  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually reinforces the title ('The Horrifying Last Moments Of Orca Trainer Sam Collins') by depicting both the 'before' (joyful trainer with orca) and the implied 'after' (orca attacking, blood, human limb) sides of a tragic incident, matching the 'horrifying last moments' theme.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is a clear intended narrative progression; no major mismatch, but the trainer\u2019s happy expression and audience\u2019s celebration vs the graphic violence heightens the emotional shock, emphasizing the shift from safety to danger. Additionally, the name 'Sam Collins' is not visually referenced, nor is a clear identity established for the trainer."
