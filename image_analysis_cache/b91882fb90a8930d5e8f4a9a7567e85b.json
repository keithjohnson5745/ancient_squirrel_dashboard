  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail\u2019s text ('The 1% rule') directly connects to the idea of forming 'Tiny Habits' as mentioned in the video title, implying that small, consistent actions (the 1% rule) can lead to significant results, reinforcing the concept of habits that create wealth.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text does not reference '17 Tiny Habits' or wealth/success directly, focusing instead on a specific principle ('The 1% rule') rather than the broader topic of multiple habits or explicit financial gain. However, the thoughtful, professional look of the subject does subtly reinforce themes of productivity and self-improvement."
