    "Visual metaphors or symbols": [

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by showing what appear to be ancient or historically-styled containers, possibly filled with substances like powders and oils that could be lubricants. The presence of gloved hands reinforces the idea of experimentation or hands-on demonstration, in line with the concept of 'getting slippery.'",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no explicit sign of 'slippery' action or use in the image\u2014just the ingredients and vessels. The thumbnail may not immediately communicate 'lubricant' without relying on the viewer's interpretation or curiosity prompted by the title."
