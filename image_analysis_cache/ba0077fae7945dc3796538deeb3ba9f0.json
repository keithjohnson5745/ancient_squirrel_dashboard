  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Thumbnail reinforcement": "The visuals use euphemisms (cucumber for penis), danger/fire effects, and common objects (lotion, hot tub) to illustrate actions/things related to the video topic and align with the title's warning about what NOT to do with one's penis.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "The thumbnail is playful and uses visual innuendo, while the title is direct and explicit. The thumbnail avoids showing anything graphic, instead employing humor and metaphor (burning cucumber, prohibition symbols). Both elements combine to create intrigue and clarity without being inappropriate for YouTube guidelines."
