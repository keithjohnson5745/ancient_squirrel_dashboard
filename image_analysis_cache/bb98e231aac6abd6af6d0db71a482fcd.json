  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How Thumbnail Reinforces Title": "The thumbnail visually depicts the act of measuring and pouring (feeding) nutrients\u2014directly connecting to the 'Feeding Cannabis Nutrients' theme in the title. The check and X suggest there's a secret or specific way that's correct (implied secret method). The use of nutrient solution (associated with cannabis growing) visually matches the focus in the title.",
    "Contrasts or Mismatches": "There is no direct depiction of cannabis plants or leaves aside from a subtle pattern in the background, so the reference is primarily implied through props and context. The video\u2019s title uses a blood droplet emoji (\ud83e\ude78), absent in the thumbnail. Otherwise, the instructional/secretive tone is matched visually and textually."
