  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly features a woman with flawless skin lightly touching her face, visually representing the facial hair removal topic. The large, bold text restates the core of the title (\u2018female facial hair\u2019 and \u2018remove\u2019), amplifying the promise of effective, trustworthy information (\u2018according to a dermatologist\u2019). Clean, clinical color palette matches the professional promise of the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no significant mismatches. The thumbnail accurately echoes the title\u2019s core themes (removal, female facial hair, permanent/at-home options) and underlines the authority (dermatologist). The only minor gap is that \u2018permanent\u2019 and \u2018at-home\u2019 are not specifically written on the thumbnail, but the visual and text implications cover them broadly."
