  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail's direct question '4 TIMES A MONTH?' mirrors the core curiosity in the video title, which asks about sex frequency compared to peers. The questioning facial expression matches the title's investigative/comparative tone.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail is more specific and punchy ('4 TIMES A MONTH?'), while the title is broader and more analytical ('Are You Having As Much Sex as Your Peers? | Sex Frequency Across Age Groups'). The specificity in the thumbnail potentially sets a benchmark, which might not reflect the full diversity discussed in the video."
