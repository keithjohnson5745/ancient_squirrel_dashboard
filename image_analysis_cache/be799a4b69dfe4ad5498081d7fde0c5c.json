  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail specifically repeats the main title promise in large, high-visibility Bangla text. The bright orange alarm clock, held up, visually metaphorizes the 'time increase' or 'duration expansion' implied by the title (making 30 seconds last 30 minutes). The inclusion of the doctor's image reinforces the authority and credibility claimed in the title and hashtag.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no clear mismatch; the thumbnail, text, and the video title are highly coordinated. Both promise a dramatic, almost 'life-hack' style solution\u2014presumably in a medical, health, or productivity context\u2014using visual, textual, and authority cues in unison."
