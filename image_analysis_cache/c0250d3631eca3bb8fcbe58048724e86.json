    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatches. However, the title's focus on 'best' is not as visually prominent in the thumbnail, which leans more towards the comparison in the context of 'emergency use.' The professional branding (doctor's image/name) also reinforces the authority implied in the title."
