  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a woman sitting outdoors at night, appearing vulnerable and carrying her belongings, which visually supports the video's title about addiction and homelessness in Miami. Her direct gaze and the raw, unposed feel reinforce the premise of an interview or personal story.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no significant mismatches. The absence of text makes the thumbnail dependent on the video title for context, but the imagery strongly supports the stated narrative of homelessness and addiction. The geographic element ('Miami') in the title is only subtly present in the urban environment\u2014nothing explicitly suggests Miami as the location in the image alone."
