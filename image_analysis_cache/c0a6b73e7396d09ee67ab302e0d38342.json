  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The close-up of a glowing, active brain with sparkling orange highlights directly supports the title\u2019s claim of brain activation, enhanced memory, and intelligence. The blue/orange color contrast highlights energy and transformation, echoing terms like 'Activate 100% of Your Brain.' The neural network background reinforces the idea of brainwaves (alpha waves) and mental connectivity.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No overt contrast or mismatch. However, the title is very bold/scientific-sounding, while the thumbnail opts for a stylized, almost fantastical representation rather than strictly medical or scientific imagery."
