  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Both highlight the topic of visa-free travel to the US in 2025. The text matches the title\u2019s focus, with added visual drama from the serious figure and the airport/travel setting, embodying the idea of border entry.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not directly specify \u20182025\u2019 or show the number \u201810\u2019 (from \u2018Top 10\u2019 in the title), so it generalizes the concept rather than specifically matching the list structure or future focus of the title."
