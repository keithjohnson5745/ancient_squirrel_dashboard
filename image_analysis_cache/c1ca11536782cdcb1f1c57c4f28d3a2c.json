  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No notable contrasts; the thumbnail and title are closely aligned. Both use direct, attention-catching language and metaphor, and the image of the speaker (with a quizzical/neutral expression) signals discussion or demystification, matching the likely content."
