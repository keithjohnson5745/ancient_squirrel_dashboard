  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Thumbnail reinforcement of title": "The thumbnail does not directly contain references to 'Posle' or '720HD', but the visually prominent broken heart and expressive human face suggest dramatic, possibly romantic themes, which could tie into the narrative hinted at in the title (especially if 'Posle' refers to an emotional aftermath). The '720HD' indicates video quality, not impacting the thumbnail.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no visible textual reinforcement of the title in the thumbnail. The content relies solely on emotional and symbolic cues rather than explicit title representation. No direct imagery relating to 'HD' or graphical reference to the full title."
