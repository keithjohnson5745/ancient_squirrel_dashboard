    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of the recognizable host in mid-explanation or debate, paired with the clear 'ASK STEVE' branding, reinforces the show's interactive Q&A format that is implied by the title ('Ask Steve').

    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is more neutral and focuses on the host\u2019s expression rather than depicting literal references to lying, drunkenness, or marriage. Visuals do not directly show or allude to the specific scenarios in the title; the connection is primarily through the host\u2019s reaction and the show\u2019s format."
