  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image directly shows a person testing a car anti-theft device (with a power drill) inside a car, visually representing the 'testing' described in the title. The repeated Amazon logo connects back to 'from Amazon!' in the title, clearly linking the products to their source.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts; both title and thumbnail emphasize real-world testing of Amazon-purchased devices. Potentially, the use of a power drill (an extreme testing method) adds an extra layer of drama compared to what some viewers might expect from 'testing,' but this reinforces the thumbnail as intriguing and click-worthy."
