  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image graphically depicts the life-threatening peril associated with long-term wilderness survival, dramatizing the hardship and risk advertised by the concept of earning $10,000 every day you survive. 'DAY 37' emphasizes the prolonged effort, while the battle with a bear visually underscores the extremity of the survival challenge.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts: both communicate heightened danger and the perseverance needed to survive. The thumbnail, however, exaggerates the immediate peril (bear attack) beyond what the title explicitly states, using a near-cinematic disaster moment to maximize viewer curiosity/shock."
