  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail strongly reinforces the video title by visually displaying the specific product (vaginal/vulva moisturizer) that matches the title's focus on 'Best Vaginal Moisturizers'. The word 'Best' is called out brightly, syncing with the comparative/review nature of the video.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatches. The only minor gap is that while the title promises a 'Top 5' round-up, the thumbnail exclusively shows jars of a single brand (Vanibiss), potentially suggesting less variety than implied by the title, but this may still be representative if Vanibiss is reviewed multiple times. There is no explicit mention visually of '2024' or 'Top 5' in the thumbnail itself."
