  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The large text mirrors the 'Maximize Your Size' title directly. The small-to-large mushroom progression visually dramatizes 'maximization'. The surprised and excited facial expressions enhance the promise of an impressive result, echoing the title\u2019s confident tone. The use of medical attire hints at 'proven plan' and authority.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses a family-friendly metaphor (mushrooms) instead of explicit imagery, which is more suggestive and playful relative to the direct reference to 'Penile Shrinkage' in the title. This maintains platform guidelines and broadens appeal while still communicating the main concept."
