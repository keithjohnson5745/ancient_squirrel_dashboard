  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features the two main subjects of the meeting\u2014the Canadian PM (assumed to be Mark Carney, per title) and Donald Trump\u2014as focal points, visually representing the key event described in the title. Background flag colors reinforce their respective national identities and the international scope of the discussion.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatches. Both individuals are shown solo; there is no depiction of the actual 'meeting' (i.e., they are not pictured together or interacting), but this is common in thumbnails designed to build anticipation. Otherwise, the thumbnail clearly aligns with the title\u2019s promise of a first-time, high-stakes meeting about tariffs between major leaders."
