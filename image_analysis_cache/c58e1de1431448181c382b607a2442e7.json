  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail text directly echoes key title topics ('Improving Sexual & Urological Health...'), faces of both a male and female align with addressing both genders, and the presence of Dr. Rena Malik\u2019s name clarifies the expert featured.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail omits the 'urological' aspect explicitly and focuses only on 'sexual health'; however, this simplifies and strengthens the visual message for quick impact. The title specifies 'males and females' while the visual only shows one of each gender rather than broader diversity."
