    },
    "Main objects/props featured": [

      "Large yellow curved arrow pointing from the text to the vegetables"
    ],
    "Background environment": "Solid bright purple with scattered white speckling/texturing, non-realistic, draws focus to foreground subjects"

  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Provocative, informative, slightly humorous due to visual metaphor; designed to spark curiosity and surprise",

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly supports the title by featuring the terms 'PENILE' and 'GIRTH', and using the vegetables and arrow as visual metaphors for changes in penile girth. The woman in medical attire hints at authority (a urologist), linking to the 'explains' part of the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The imagery is more playful and suggestive than strictly scientific, using humor rather than clinical graphics, but otherwise closely matches the title\u2019s subject and intent."
