  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually represents the primary symptom (urinary frequency/urgency) associated with BPH by showing a man about to urinate, paired with a surprised medical professional, directly linking to the video topic of 'Why Men Get an Enlarged Prostate and How to Treat BPH Symptoms.' The text reiterates the symptom in a way that is immediate and relatable.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail is slightly more casual/humorous (with its outdoor urination and playful arrow) than the formal and medical video title, potentially making the video seem more accessible and less clinical than the title suggests."
