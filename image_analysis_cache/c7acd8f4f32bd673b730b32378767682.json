  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The visual evokes the act and context alluded to in the title ('How to use LUBRICANT correctly for RELATIONSHIPS'), using playful food metaphors and a bottle that could be read as lubricant/oil. The hand placement with papaya seeds amplifies the sexual undertone matching the subject matter.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail uses metaphor and innuendo rather than literal imagery of lubricant or couples, aligning with YouTube policy but leaving the precise topic (proper use of lubricant for relationships) implicit rather than explicit. The visual humor/light innuendo may contrast with viewers expecting a purely clinical or serious tutorial."
