The demonstration with a prop further suggests a practical or review-oriented video.",
    "Contrasts/mismatches": "No significant contrasts or mismatches; the explicit use of a realistic prop may be more provocative than suggested by the straightforward product focus of the title, but it remains contextually relevant and supports demonstration purposes."
