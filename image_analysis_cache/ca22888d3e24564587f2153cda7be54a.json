  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail includes the same provocative topic as the title\u2014frequency of ejaculation and its health impacts. It emphasizes the Q&A/AMA (Ask Me Anything) format, making it clear that these are expert answers. Bright, engaging faces and expressive gestures generate trust and curiosity, aligning with the directness of the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail focuses solely on the 'frequent ejaculation' health aspect and the AMA format, but does not visually represent the secondary topic in the title ('Sildenafil vs. Tadafil'). The drugs mentioned are entirely absent in the thumbnail, so viewers might not expect that topic from the image alone."
