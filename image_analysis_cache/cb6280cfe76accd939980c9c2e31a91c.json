    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No strong contrasts or mismatches; the thumbnail visually and explicitly matches the directness of the title. The only slight contrast is the casual facial expression (skeptical/cheeky) which adds playfulness in an otherwise clinical topic."
