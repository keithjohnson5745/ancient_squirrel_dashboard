  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail repeats the exact wording of the title's main hook ('7 Ways to Torture a Narcissist') and visually emphasizes key trigger words in bold, yellow text. Including the image of a woman confidently delivering a message aligns with the idea of expert guidance or instruction. 'INSPIRED BY MEL ROBBINS' in the title is reinforced by both the portrait and her name featured prominently.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is very close alignment; both are direct and provocative. However, the word 'torture' is not visually reinforced by aggressive imagery\u2014no literal or negative symbols are used, which softens the impact visually compared to the title's strong language."
