  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The title references 'The Voice' (a game show centered around selection and judgment) adapted to a dating scenario. The thumbnail shows a clear dating-choice mechanism: two people are visually ready to make a decision, a large button (like 'The Voice'), a curtain with 'contestants' waiting, and the text 'DATE OR PASS?' echoing the show's format. The expressions and button visually connect the dating context to the 'game show' feeling of 'The Voice'.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatches. Both thumbnail and title clearly communicate a selection-based dating game inspired by 'The Voice'. The only subtle difference: the central figure is male, while 'The Voice' typically has multiple judges; this makes it more of a direct one-on-one (or two-on-one) dating selection, but the reference is still clear and effective."
