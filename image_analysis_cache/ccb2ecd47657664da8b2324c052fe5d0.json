    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail repeats the primary theme of the title by featuring the phrase 'SEX OVER 50!' in bold, which both directly references the video's topic and matches the phrasing of the title.

Lightning bolt symbolizes energy and vitality, reinforcing a positive spin.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There are no overt contrasts or mismatches; both the title and thumbnail are closely aligned in theme and message. The thumbnail is a bit more clinical and positive, potentially toning down any taboo aspect the title might evoke, focusing on information and support."
