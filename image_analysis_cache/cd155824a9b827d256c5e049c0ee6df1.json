  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The presence of a reproductive health expert (doctor) visually anchors credibility for a discussion on fertility and related issues like lubrication. The text promises an in-depth and open Q&A, which ties into addressing specific fertility concerns such as coconut oil\u2019s effect on conception.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "While the title specifically mentions 'coconut oil' and 'lubrication,' there is no direct visual cue (like images of coconut oil, lubrication products, or symbolic reproductive imagery) in the thumbnail, making the match partial rather than direct. The focus is on the authority/expertise rather than the specific topic."
