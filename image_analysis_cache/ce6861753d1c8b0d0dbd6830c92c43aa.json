  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly shows Johnson's Baby Soap held up in a way that matches the idea of a pH reveal or investigation, matching the expos\u00e9 tone of the title ('Shocking Truth'). The up-close view emphasizes scrutiny or a deeper look into the product.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no direct indication of 'shocking' or negative connotation in the image itself\u2014no facial expressions of surprise or textual cues to signify drama\u2014so the emotional energy of the title is not visually echoed in the thumbnail, making the connection more informational than sensational."
