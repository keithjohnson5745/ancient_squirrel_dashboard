  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail displays nipple-shaped props (directly referencing 'NIPPLE PLAY') and the phrase '\u0910\u0938\u0947 \u0916\u0947\u0932\u094b\u0902 \u0906\u090f\u0917\u093e \u092e\u091c\u093e' ('This way you'll have fun/real enjoyment'), clearly connecting to the title '\u0910\u0938\u0947 \u0916\u0947\u0932\u0928\u0947 \u0938\u0947 \u0906\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948 \u0905\u0938\u0932\u0940 \u092e\u091c\u093e' (Playing like this brings real fun). The presence of the woman (presumably Dr. Neho Mehto) pointing towards the text gives an instructional/educational vibe, reinforcing the 'how to' or 'tip-sharing' nature implied in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatches: the thumbnail and the title both focus on 'nipple play' and enjoyment, and iconography (props) visually support the content promised by the title. However, the text 'NIPPLE PLAY' in large, bold English is more direct and potentially provocative than the relatively tamer Hindi title, which uses more euphemistic/innocent language."
