  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "Thumbnail visually amplifies the video's title ('99% Of People Don't Know WD40's Dark Secret') by directly displaying both: the percentage claim and heavy focus on the WD-40 product, implying mysteriousness/secrecy with a bold, attention-grabbing design.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No overt visual contradiction \u2013 both the thumbnail and title play on an appeal to curiosity and secret knowledge; however, while the title uses 'Dark Secret' for extra intrigue, the thumbnail itself does not use the word 'secret' or any visually dark elements, relying instead on the implication created by the arrow and percentage."
