  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The title suggests something shocking or unjust happened ('You won\u2019t believe what the man did to the innocent house help'). The visual of a single woman, apparently distressed, covered with a towel and lying on a bed, evokes concern and curiosity. This supports the narrative implied by the title, hinting at vulnerability or mistreatment.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is overall alignment: the visual reinforces the title\u2019s emotional and dramatic intent. However, the thumbnail does not specify who the 'man' is or show any action, relying solely on facial expression and body language to set the emotional tone and drive intrigue."
