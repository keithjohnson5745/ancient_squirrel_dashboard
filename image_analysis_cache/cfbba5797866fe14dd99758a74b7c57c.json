  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail's text ('FRICTION & WEAR') are the exact subjects of the video title ('Fact or Friction? TWO Things MOST People DON'T Know About Wear.'). The inclusion of an actual testing component and scientific authority figure, plus the excited gesture, visually promises a reveal or knowledge beyond the obvious\u2014themes central to the title's 'things most people don't know.'",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail says 'FRICTION & WEAR', but does not visually reference the idea of 'Fact or Friction?' or emphasize the 'TWO Things' that the title claims most people don't know about wear. The emotional tone is mainly positive/enthusiastic, which may slightly downplay the quiz/challenge implied in the title."
