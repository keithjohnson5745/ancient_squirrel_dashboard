    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The title refers to '\u091b\u0924\u0930\u0940' (umbrella), but visually the thumbnail depicts opening a condom packet\u2014'\u091b\u0924\u0930\u0940' is common slang for condom in Hindi, so this matches thematically despite literal contrast. No major mismatch for a viewer familiar with regional usage."
