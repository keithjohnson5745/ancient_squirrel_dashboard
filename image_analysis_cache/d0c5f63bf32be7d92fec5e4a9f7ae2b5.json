  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the video's catastrophic claim ('THE END for Pakistan') by showing a distressed/crying figure identified with Pakistan, missiles, and another figure (presumably representing India) in a confident gesture, alongside a tweet-style bold claim. This visually dramatizes the stakes and aligns with the title's war/end provocation.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major mismatch, but the use of a tweet format might falsely imply the actual statement is from a real leader's account. The emotional and aggressive tone in the thumbnail closely matches the video's provocative title."
