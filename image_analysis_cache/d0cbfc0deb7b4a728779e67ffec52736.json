  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Both thumbnail text and the video title emphasize the '5 dangerous vegetables' seniors should avoid. The thumbnail dramatizes the risk ('NEVER TOUCH', 'SHORTEN YOUR LIFE'), concisely mirroring and intensifying the video title. The presence of a medical professional enhances credibility, appealing to the 'Senior Health Tips' aspect in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail only mentions the 'dangerous vegetables' and negative outcomes, omitting reference to the '5 you must eat' aspect highlighted in the video title. This may create an expectation of a more fear-based or warning-focused video, with less focus on positive health tips."
