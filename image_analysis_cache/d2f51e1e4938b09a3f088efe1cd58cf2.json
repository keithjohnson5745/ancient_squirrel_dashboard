  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly supports the title by visually depicting an adult in a child-focused environment (stuffed animals), poised to deliver a helpful tip, echoing 'The Secret to Helping ANY Child Follow Your Directions'. The bold text 'WORKS EVERY TIME' amplifies the idea that a solution is being offered.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is no obvious mismatch; however, the thumbnail does not show an actual child, only toys representing children. The visual strongly cues child-interaction, but if someone expects to see children with the presenter, that is not fulfilled in the thumbnail."
