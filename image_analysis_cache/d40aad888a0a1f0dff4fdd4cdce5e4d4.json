    "Visual reinforcement of title": "The tranquil water, lush greenery, and soft natural light support the idea of relaxation, sleep, meditation, and stress relief.

The visual atmosphere and symbolic elements strongly align with themes of relaxation, meditation, and endless ('infinity') peace referenced in the title. There is no literal depiction of flight, but the bird and airy scene serve a metaphorical role."
