  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "Thumbnail text and visuals explicitly challenge IVF (a conventional approach to conception), aligning with the video\u2019s title about getting pregnant naturally/quickly. The smiling figure and nurturing hands support positive, natural result messaging.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail says to 'STOP DOING IVF,' which is a more provocative, negative frame than the positive promise of 'Getting pregnant fast naturally!' The focus is on an alternative, not the natural methods themselves. There is no explicit visual reference to 'natural' pregnancy in the thumbnail, only the implied alternative to IVF."
