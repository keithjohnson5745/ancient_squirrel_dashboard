  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows a direct side-by-side comparison of several lubricants, all clearly labeled, with additional handwritten labels specifying 'Rubber' and showing where each product is applied/tested. This directly visualizes the core question posed in the title about which lubricant is safe for rubber.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no explicit mention of safety (e.g., 'SAFE' or hazard symbols), but the setup, range of products, and rubber-focused labeling on the pipe make the safety/testing concern visually clear."
