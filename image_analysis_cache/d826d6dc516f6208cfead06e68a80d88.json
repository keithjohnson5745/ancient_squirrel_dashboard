  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title by showing a medical professional (possibly the 'urologist' from the title) and an older woman, who could be going through menopause. The text in the thumbnail directly references the topic of women and testosterone. The questioning gestures and facial expressions visually echo the 'breaks down the science' and 'do all women need...?' doubt raised in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatch; the thumbnail aligns well with the title. Both visually and textually, it focuses on the question of women and testosterone in menopause. The only minor gap is the thumbnail's phrasing is general ('WOMEN TAKING TESTOSTERONE?!'), whereas the title is specific to menopause and the scientific breakdown by a urologist."
