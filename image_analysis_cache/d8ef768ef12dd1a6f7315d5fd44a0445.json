  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The use of a fire hydrant gushing water toward a person's face is a humorous but clear metaphor for 'increasing semen volume' and 'fuller loads,' directly connecting to the video's sexual health topic. The bold, urgent text mirrors the intensity and immediacy suggested in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "While the visual is metaphorical and comedic, it does not directly show medical or biological imagery, which could lead to a mismatch in seriousness or scientific credibility. It relies on innuendo and exaggeration rather than factual visual representation."
