  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail text directly references the video's subject ('EDGE'), while the shocked/excited expression visually dramatizes the concept. The sweat drops amplify the idea of being on the brink or at an 'edge.' The wavy underline visually cues the notion of a boundary or climax, subtly tied to the topic of edging.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no major contrasts; both the thumbnail and the title are provocative and strongly connected. The thumbnail's playful visual exaggeration may lean more towards clickbait than the somewhat informative title."
