  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail clearly visualizes a confrontation between airport staff (police/security) and a professionally dressed Black woman, directly referencing the 'staff kicked Jasmine Crockett.' The presence of a man in a suit being circled (presumably 'her husband') further visually connects to the title's 'regret when her husband arrived.' The use of arrows and circles accentuates the drama alluded to in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There\u2019s no literal 'kicking out' happening in the thumbnail, just a dramatic altercation or confrontation, which may exaggerate actual events. There\u2019s no specific regret depicted, just tense anticipation or standoff. Also, no visible text confirms the identity of the characters for the viewer."
