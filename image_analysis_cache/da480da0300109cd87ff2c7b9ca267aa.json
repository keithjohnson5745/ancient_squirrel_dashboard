    },
    "Main objects/props featured": "No prominent props; main focus is the woman speaking on stage.",

  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {
    "Overall emotional tone": "Serious, contemplative, somewhat somber. Suggests a difficult, grave topic.",
    "Visual metaphors or symbols": "The subject\u2019s open hand gesture and facial expression symbolize openness, vulnerability, or seeking understanding. The stark lighting and dark background reinforce the gravity of the subject matter.",

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The woman\u2019s serious and contemplative look, along with her open-handed gesture, visually matches the gravity and complexity of the topic stated in the title ('Why domestic violence victims don't leave'). The familiar TED stage setting suggests an informative and authoritative talk.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatch: the visual is appropriate for the sensitive, serious subject matter. However, the thumbnail does not visually depict domestic violence or victimization directly; instead, it relies on the speaker\u2019s presence and TED brand symbolism to imply expertise and seriousness on the topic."
