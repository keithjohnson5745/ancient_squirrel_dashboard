  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail focuses only on the apple's appearance, not giving any indication of the grape flavor; the shock word 'ABOMINATION' adds drama, while the smiling face lightens the effect. The tone is exaggerated for humor and curiosity, matching the title's sense of bizarre or unexpected experimentation."
