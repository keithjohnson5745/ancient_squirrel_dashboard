  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Thumbnail directly addresses the question posed in the title about masturbation and stamina, using the battery icon to represent energy/stamina, and the distressed young man as a visual cue for negative consequences. The doctor figure mirrors the title's reference to medical expertise ('Dr. Sunil Jindal | Jindal Hospital Meerut'). The mix of English/Hindi text reflects the bilingual nature of the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No clear mismatch; the visual explicitly supports the title's alarmist framing; both focus on energy and physical strength in relation to masturbation, targeting the same concerns in the intended audience."
