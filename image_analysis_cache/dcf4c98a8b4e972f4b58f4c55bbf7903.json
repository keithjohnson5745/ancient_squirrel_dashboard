  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title strongly. Both focus on the Vaseline jar (central product) and suggest reasons to use it (direct command, association with expertise via the person present). The white arrow visually bridges the text command to the product, echoing the title's persuasive intention.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatch, though the thumbnail is more direct/simple ('USE THIS') versus the more explanatory format of the title ('10 Reasons to Use Vaseline on the Face | Dermatologist'). The title mentions a dermatologist/expert and the thumbnail visually emphasizes expertise via a professional appearance, but does not display medical credentials explicitly."
