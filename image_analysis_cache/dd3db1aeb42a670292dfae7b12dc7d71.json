  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image directly depicts a crying mother bear with a limp cub approaching a man, echoing the video's title scenario.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No apparent mismatches. Both thumbnail and title rely on heightened emotion and drama; both make the animal's distress a focal point, increasing potential viewer curiosity and empathy."
