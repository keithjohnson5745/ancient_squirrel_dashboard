  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The text in the thumbnail is a simplified, more provocative version of the video title, directly asking the central question. The presence of a woman in a doctor\u2019s coat positions the content as medically authoritative, while the secondary image of a couple in bed visually represents the theme of the refractory period and male sexual performance.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses a more conversational and triggering question ('Men Can't Go for Round 2?') compared to the more clinical and explanatory full video title. The image avoids explicit sexual content, opting instead for innuendo and implication."
