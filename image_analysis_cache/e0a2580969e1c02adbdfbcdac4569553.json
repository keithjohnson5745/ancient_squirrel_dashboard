    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is slightly more focused on general sensuality and the concept of \u2018healing through sex,\u2019 whereas the title is explicit about a specific goal ('How To Give Women Vaginal Orgasms'). The image is suggestive but not graphic, allowing for broader appeal while still staying relevant to the topic."
