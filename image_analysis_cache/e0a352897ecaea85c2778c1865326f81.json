  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly addresses the topic of heart health and prevention (central theme of the title) by showing a cardiac patient, a doctor, and raises a provocative question about the reliability of ECGs \u2013 a common tool in heart attack detection/prevention. The inclusion of a Padma Bhushan-awarded expert aligns with 'Cardiac Surgeon'.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail text 'ECG IS TOTALLY USELESS?' is more provocative and emotionally loaded compared to the relatively educational/positive tone of the video title ('Watch this to never get a heart attack'). The title promises prevention/advice, while the thumbnail teases a controversial take on a standard medical test, which may not be fully aligned but serves to draw attention."
