    "Font characteristics": {
      "Style": "Bold, sans-serif, all uppercase",
      "Emphasis": "Strong black outline with white fill, \u2018BENEFITS\u2019 has a red background/box for extra emphasis",

  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "The thumbnail text directly references and amplifies the video title by adding urgency ('SHOCKING') and focusing on 'benefits', paralleling 'impacts' in the title.

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail uses the word 'shocking' which is a stronger and more emotional trigger than the title's 'incredible'; otherwise, both are well aligned in focus on red light therapy\u2019s positive effects."
