  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Reinforcement": "Thumbnail visually reiterates the video's title by explicitly displaying the main message (\u2018MASTURBATE!!!\u2019 prevents ED) in bold letters and by the presenter's expressive, engaging pose, indicating an important or counter-intuitive topic.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatch; the thumbnail is tightly aligned with the title in both tone (provocative, direct) and content (prevention of erectile dysfunction by masturbation). However, the presence of a woman as the central figure may slightly contrast with the topic's primary male focus, but this may also convey inclusivity or medical authority."
