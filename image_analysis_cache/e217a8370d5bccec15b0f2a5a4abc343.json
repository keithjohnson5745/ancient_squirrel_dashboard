  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail\u2019s 'BACK TO 80s' text and neon-retro aesthetics directly support the title 'Ultimate 80s Classics \u2013 Timeless Icons in One Playlist' by immediately signaling the 1980s theme and tapping into visual nostalgia for that era. The bright colors, bold typography, and geometric graphics are all visual shorthand for 80s pop culture.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no significant mismatches. If anything, the thumbnail is slightly broader (just '80s', no specific 'classics' or 'icons') but fits perfectly with the playlist concept and genre of the title."
