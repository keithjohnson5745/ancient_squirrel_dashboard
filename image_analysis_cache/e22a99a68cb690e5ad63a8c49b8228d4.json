  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually supports the title's claim that certain foods are 'unbelievably bad' for the 'D' (commonly understood as innuendo for male health) by featuring foods (meat, oats, eggplant) with dramatic emphasis (fire, 'FAKE' label, alarmed facial expression), all implying harm. The large flaming eggplant visually hints at the double meaning.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "There is strong alignment between the alarmist title and the thumbnail warning visuals. However, the thumbnail does not specifically enumerate '4 foods' as per the title, though it shows three (meat, oats, eggplant), and the meaning of 'D' relies on innuendo rather than explicit naming."
