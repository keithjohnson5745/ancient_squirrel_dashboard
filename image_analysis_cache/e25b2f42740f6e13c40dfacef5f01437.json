  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The image of a young girl aiming a slingshot/bow directly at a threatening, snarling wolf visually matches the video's title about a girl defending her family from a wolf pack. The confrontation and courage implied by the title are immediately evident in the image.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The title references a 'family' and a 'wolf pack,' but only a single girl and one wolf are visible. The slingshot/bow appears more primitive and large than a typical slingshot, but otherwise the overall scenario is closely aligned with the title's narrative."
