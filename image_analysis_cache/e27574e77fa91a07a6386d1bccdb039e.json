  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail clearly features a bottle of lubricant as its central prop, immediately referencing the video\u2019s topic ('Anal Lube'). The professional, clinical yet friendly setting complements the educational promise in the title 'Why You MUST Use Anal Lube,' signaling an open conversation rather than sensationalism. The presence of books on sexual health/expertise and the clear, engaged presenter further reinforce the title's authority.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a slight contrast: the title uses strong, imperative language ('MUST'), which is more urgent and dramatic than the calm, controlled, and inviting thumbnail image. The thumbnail does not use any provocative imagery or highly suggestive visuals, keeping the mood informative rather than sensational, which may soften the title\u2019s boldness."
