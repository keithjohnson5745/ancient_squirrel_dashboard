  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "Directly references the content of the title by showing a white, crystalline/powder substance (implied to be lidocaine) and using the explicit phrase 'FROM ANAL LUBE', matching the title's focus on extraction from a specific source. The arrow further guides viewers from the words to the extracted material.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no significant mismatch. Both title and thumbnail are explicit and direct; the thumbnail chooses not to show the product packaging and instead uses language and imagery for maximum provocation and clarity."
