  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail immediately connects to the topic of menstruation via the prominent use of red (suggesting blood) and the word 'PERIOD' in large font, while 'MYTHS' matches the fact-busting or educational angle mentioned in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail uses simpler, punchier language ('PERIOD MYTHS') than the more scientific and time-specific title ('The science of menstruation in 10 minutes | Dr. Jen Gunter'), but this enhances accessibility; both elements work together to promise myth-busting and quick information."
