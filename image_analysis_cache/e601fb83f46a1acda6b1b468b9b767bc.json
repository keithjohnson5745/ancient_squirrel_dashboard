  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail presents the same woman in positive, friendly poses and as a mugshot, visually underscoring a drastic contrast between public persona and alleged criminal behavior mentioned in the title. The inclusion of the Law & Crime logo directly connects the visual narrative to legal/criminal consequences as described by the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail\u2019s warm, inviting imagery of the woman (smiling, approachable, styled carefully) sharply contrasts with the serious and disturbing allegations in the title involving a teacher and an underage student. The visual does not directly reference the alleged crime or illicit acts, making the criminal aspect less explicit and relying instead on subtext and context."
