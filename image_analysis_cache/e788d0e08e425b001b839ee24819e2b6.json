  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a heavily muscled, distinctly non-modern human (Neanderthal) paired with the direct text 'NOT LIKE US' visually asserts the theme of Neanderthals being radically different and perhaps extraordinary\u2014aligning with the video's titled claim that they were 'Absolute Freaks Of Nature.' The intense depiction and word choice both dramatize and reinforce the central thesis.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is direct alignment between image and title; both stress otherness and uniqueness of Neanderthals compared to modern humans. The thumbnail makes the video's message clear and consistent, no evident mismatch."
