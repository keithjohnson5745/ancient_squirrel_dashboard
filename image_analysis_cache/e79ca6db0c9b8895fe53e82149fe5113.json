  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail centers on the paradoxical phrase 'SUBMISSIVE FEMINIST', visually echoing the video's premise (the tension between feminism and enjoying submissive or taboo fantasies). The expressions of shock and seriousness mirror the provocative and controversial nature suggested by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The explicit word 'rape fantasy' is not present in the thumbnail, making the visual slightly tamer than the title, but the word 'SUBMISSIVE' and the extreme expressions hint at taboo or controversial subject matter. The thumbnail is suggestive but avoids explicit references, likely to avoid YouTube restrictions while remaining provocative."
