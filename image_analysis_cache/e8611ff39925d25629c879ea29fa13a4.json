    "All text visible in the thumbnail": "SIGNS OF EARLY PREGNANCY",
    "Font characteristics": {
      "style": "Bold, sans-serif, all caps",

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the video's core topic by combining the key emotional and medical symbol (pregnancy test), prominent, clear text repeating the main keywords ('Signs', 'Pregnancy'), and an expert figure (presumably Dr. Lora Shahine). The color and text make it clear the content is informative regarding early signs.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "Minor: The thumbnail does not explicitly visualize the 'two week wait' or 'mistakes to avoid' mentioned in the title. The focus is entirely on 'signs of early pregnancy.' However, overall alignment between title and thumbnail is strong for main topic."
