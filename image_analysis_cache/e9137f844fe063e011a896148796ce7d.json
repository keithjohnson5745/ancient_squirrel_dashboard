  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail features prominent keywords directly tied to the video title ('implantation symptoms'). The doctor\u2019s presence and medical imagery visually support the subject matter of early pregnancy and testing. The TWW (Two Week Wait) acronym, well known in fertility discussions, directly references the anxiety-ridden waiting period post-ovulation when symptoms are scrutinized\u2014connecting closely with the title\u2019s focus on implantation, symptoms, and testing timing.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not directly depict pregnancy tests or early pregnancy tests, which are mentioned in the title; it focuses instead on the wait and symptoms, potentially omitting visual cues about the actual testing step. Otherwise, the visual and textual emphasis is closely aligned with the informational promise of the title."
