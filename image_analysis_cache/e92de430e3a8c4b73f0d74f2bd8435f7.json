    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There are no major mismatches; the imagery and text support the premise of urgent preparation due to crisis. The title implies action ('Start PREPARING Yourself'), while the thumbnail visually dramatizes the reason to act (the collapse itself), making them highly complementary."
