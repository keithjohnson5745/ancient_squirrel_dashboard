  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Thumbnail reinforces title": "The thumbnail uses a direct quote ('DON'T MAKE IT TOO HOT!') that hints at the video's focus on safe practices during anal sex, matching the medical/advice aspect promised by the title. Professionally dressed speakers and medical branding reinforce the 'gastroenterologist' angle.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail avoids direct mention of 'anal sex' or explicit imagery, likely to comply with YouTube guidelines and broaden appeal; instead, it relies on innuendo and curiosity, which may slightly underplay the topic's explicitness compared to the video's clear, direct title."
