    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly reflects the video title by depicting analysts ('Inside' crew) on either side and an explosive in-game celebration (likely Aaron Gordon\u2019s game-winner) in the middle, matching the discussion of a key NBA moment.

    "Contrasts or mismatches": "While Joki\u0107 is mentioned in the title for his 'insane stat line', he is not visually featured or highlighted within the thumbnail. The focus is split between analysts and Aaron Gordon, with no show of explicit stats or Joki\u0107."
