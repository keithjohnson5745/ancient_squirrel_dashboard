The presence of the SQL icon and a smiling educator adds credibility and approachability, reinforcing educational intent.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "Minimal mismatch. The thumbnail omits 'TO GET YOU HIRED' language, instead using 'Most Asked'\u2014which is a slight shift from the title\u2019s explicit job-getting focus toward emphasizing commonality/value. However, the rest of the text and visuals cohesively align with the video's topic as described in the title."
