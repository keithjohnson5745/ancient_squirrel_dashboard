      "Photo shows action (pouring liquid), making the viewer curious about the demonstration"
    ],
    "Brand elements present": "No explicit brand logo, but the presenter may be a recognized figure (Dr. Neha Mehta as per the title); strong, consistent color branding with blue, yellow, and red."
  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses large, clear text ('LUBE \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948?') front and center, matching the main query in the video title. The demonstrative photo of a woman pouring a substance suggests a practical, informative approach, which aligns with the educational and explanatory nature signaled by '\u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u094b\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948?' and 'Which is best'. Additional text in Hindi and English ('ORAL \u092e\u0947\u0902 \u0921\u093e\u0932\u0947 FLAVOUR') references the specifics likely discussed in the video, reinforcing the bilingual explanatory approach and the subject matter about different uses of lube.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong match thematically and visually. The only minor contrast is that the thumbnail does not mention 'Which is best', which is in the title, so the comparative aspect is less visually emphasized. The thumbnail focuses more on explanation and demonstration rather than comparison."
