  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The extreme close-up of the face, highlighting skin texture and closed eyes, visually represents the 'Signs' that the skin can show when estrogen is low. The inclusion of an expert-type person points to this area, reinforcing the video's promise to explain these signs. The large \u2018LOW ESTROGEN\u2019 text directly echoes the topic in the title.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title also mentions 'hair,' but the thumbnail focuses entirely on skin and the face (no hair loss or scalp indicators presented visually), which may be seen as a slight mismatch. However, the main visual message aligns closely with the intent of the title."
