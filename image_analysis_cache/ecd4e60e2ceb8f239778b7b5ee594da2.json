  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The text on the thumbnail aligns closely with the title\u2019s implication of an outrageous or unusual request. The serious woman in military garb may accentuate the drama and tension, while the shocking ask on the thumbnail (\u2018MLIK ME!\u2019) references the unexpected scenario hinted at by \u2018What She Wanted Me to Do With That Jar.\u2019",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is no visible jar in the thumbnail, meaning the object mentioned in the title is not visually reinforced. The typo \u2018MLIK\u2019 instead of \u2018MILK\u2019 may confuse viewers, but could be a deliberate clickbait strategy. The military attire is not directly explained by the title, adding to the intrigue but possibly causing some thematic mismatch."
