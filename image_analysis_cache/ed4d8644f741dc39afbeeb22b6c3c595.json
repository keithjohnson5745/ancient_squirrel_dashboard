  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail centers on the phrase 'STIs,' signaling the video\u2019s sexual health topic, closely related to the concern in the title about genital odor and smegma. The medical professional\u2019s presence implies trustworthy, expert advice.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail is more clinical and generalized ('STIs'), while the title is sensational and specific ('Stinky Penis? Maybe It's Smegma!'). No explicit visual reference to smegma or a penis, which softens the directness of the title\u2014making the thumbnail more palatable for wider audiences."
