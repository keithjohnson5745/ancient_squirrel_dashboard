The phrase 'After 2 years' adds to the narrative of overcoming fertility problems, matching the backstory in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is strong alignment between the thumbnail and the title; both reinforce each other. The only mild mismatch is that while the title specifically mentions twins, the thumbnail does not have explicit text about 'twins'\u2014however, the ultrasound may subtly suggest it to knowledgeable viewers."
