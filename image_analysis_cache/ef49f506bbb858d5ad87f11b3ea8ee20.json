  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The left part of the thumbnail shows what looks like a hotel surveillance clip involving a male and female, which aligns closely with the narrative of an attempted escape and assault in a hotel as described in the title. The right part shows both main public figures (Cassie and a male), likely referencing the event in question and drawing a direct visual connection for viewers.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No visible text or explicit evidence of violence in the thumbnail, but the context depends on viewers' understanding of the people involved. The juxtaposition could be seen as neutral, relying on viewers' knowledge and the dramatic title to create meaning. The tone of the title (provocative and explicit language) is visually matched by the drama in the imagery."
