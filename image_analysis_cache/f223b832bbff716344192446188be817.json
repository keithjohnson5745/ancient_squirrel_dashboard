  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail's focus on 'FIX AGING LIPS' directly matches the theme of lip rejuvenation in the title. The before-and-after images visually suggest a fix or improvement, giving concrete context to the notion that there's a 'right way' to approach aging lips (implying there is a wrong way, as hinted in the title 'Why Fillers Alone Won't Fix Aging Lips'). The doctor's endorsement further aligns with the 'explained' and expert angle of the video title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not reference fillers specifically or show any tools, syringes, or procedures, which could make the connection to 'fillers alone' more explicit. It emphasizes the solution but doesn't directly visualize what methods are being discussed."
