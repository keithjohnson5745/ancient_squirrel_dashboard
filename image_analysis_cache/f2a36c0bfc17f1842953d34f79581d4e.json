  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail uses both text and visuals to echo the title's playful, attention-grabbing approach. 'THE SCREAM CREAM!' is a pun on the phrase 'not in the mood', implying the cream will have a dramatic and positive effect\u2014directly tying into 'this cream might blow your mind.' The imagery of the woman in apparent pleasure further reinforces this.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a slight contrast in tone; the thumbnail is even more explicit and sensational than the relatively coy, suggestive video title. The title hints at the subject matter while the thumbnail makes it explicit."
