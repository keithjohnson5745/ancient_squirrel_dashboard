  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly shows the Durex cherry flavored lube bottle, emphasizing the flavor and brand, which matches the keywords in the title. Repeated use of 'Juicy Play', 'Cherry', and 'Durex' visually aligns with the detailed product mention in the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The title references multiple lube types and potential uses (including 'anal lube', 'for women & men'), while the thumbnail is solely focused on the cherry flavored personal lubricant and does not explicitly depict or refer to anal use or inclusivity. However, the word 'Uses' generally implies a broad explanation as promised in the title."
