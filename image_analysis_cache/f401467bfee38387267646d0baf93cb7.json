    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail foregrounds the term 'CREPEY SKIN FIX' in large, urgent text, mirroring 'Fix Your Crepey Skin' from the title and immediately communicating the video's purpose.

    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail heavily emphasizes the 'fix' concept, but visually does not show the 'easy tips' or the process/solutions\u2014just the problem (crepey skin) and an expert. The solution aspect is implied but not depicted visually."
