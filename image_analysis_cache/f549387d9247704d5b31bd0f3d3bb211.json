  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail visually highlights the concept of things that \u2018kill\u2019 testosterone with the limp banana (symbolizing weakness/softness), arrows indicating cause/effect from unhealthy body to symbol and strong highlighted text matching keywords from the title (\u2018testosterone\u2019, \u2018soft\u2019). Woman's concerned/thoughtful look further emphasizes message.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "The thumbnail specifically focuses on one food (the banana) and body image, while the title refers broadly to seven \u2018testosterone killers\u2019; this creates curiosity but also a minor disconnect between the list aspect of the title and the banana-focused visual."
