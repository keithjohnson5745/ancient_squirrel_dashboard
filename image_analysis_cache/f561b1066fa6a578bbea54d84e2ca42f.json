  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly illustrates the title by showing a guitar (focus on knobs), visualizing 'scratchy static noise' with lightning bolts, and displaying a can of WD-40 Specialist Contact Cleaner, which is mentioned in the title. The inclusion of bold text highlights the main problem discussed in the video and suggests a solution (matching the product review aspect in the title).",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a strong match between thumbnail and title; both focus on fixing guitar knob noise with WD-40 Contact Cleaner. One minor mismatch could be that the thumbnail is phrased as a question ('Knobs Make Scratchy Static Noise?'), whereas the title suggests a resolution or fix. However, this is a common clickbait technique to entice curiosity."
