  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The image of a pregnancy test and a pregnant woman directly illustrates the subject matter of conception and fertility. The phrase 'I LEARNED TOO LATE', emphasized in magenta, visually aligns with the regretful, cautionary spirit present in the title ('5 Things I Wish I Knew Before Trying to Conceive').",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "There is a high level of cohesion; both communicate personal lessons and knowledge around conception. The image suggests a successful pregnancy but is paired with a regretful message, amplifying the cautionary intent. The only minor contrast is a lack of direct reference to the '5 things' aspect, which could hint at content specificity."
