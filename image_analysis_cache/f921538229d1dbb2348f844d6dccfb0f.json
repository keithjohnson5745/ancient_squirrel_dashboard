      "Number of people": 2,

    ],
    "Font characteristics": {

  "THEMATIC ELEMENTS": {

  },
  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail shows two people in a video call/interview setting, aligning with the idea of 'seeing through someone\u2019s lens' or having a conversation about personal experience. Their genuine expressions support an open, honest discussion, which matches the theme implied by the title.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "The thumbnail does not explicitly reference cerebral palsy (the topic), nor does it visually clarify which participant is Chelsea Bear. There are no overt visual cues about the subject matter or Chelsea Bear\u2019s specific viewpoint, so the connection relies on viewers reading the title."
