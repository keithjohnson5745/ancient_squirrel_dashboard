    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail clearly and directly supports the title by displaying 'Low Dose Vaginal Estrogen' prominently.

The phrase 'For the GenitoUrinary Syndrome of Menopause' closely matches the urinary and vaginal symptom focus in the title, visually confirming the video's medical-educational purpose.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No significant mismatches. The thumbnail, text, and tone match the focus and audience implied in the video title (informative, authoritative, practical, menopause health-focused). The only minor mismatch could be the lack of an explicit visual reference to urinary or vaginal symptoms, but the specificity of 'Vaginal Estrogen' largely compensates for this."
