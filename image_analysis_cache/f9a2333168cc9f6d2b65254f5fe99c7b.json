  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "Visual reinforcement": "The thumbnail directly visualizes the video's topic: it emphasizes lubricant visually (by showing a dispenser bottle usually associated with lube), paired with pink roses to subtly reference intimacy/romantic themes. The text 'Saliva as Lube' echoes the title's core question, making it clear what the video will address. The show branding ties it back to 'Dr. Lia'.",
    "Contrasts or mismatches": "No major mismatches; the thumbnail supports the video title both literally and indirectly (metaphorical elements with roses). The only minor contrast is that the title asks a question ('Is Saliva The New Lube?') while the thumbnail asserts a statement ('Saliva as Lube'). Otherwise, visual and thematic elements are aligned."
