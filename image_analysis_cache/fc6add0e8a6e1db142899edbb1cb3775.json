  "THUMBNAIL-TITLE RELATIONSHIP": {
    "How the thumbnail visually reinforces the title": "The thumbnail directly references the title by visually emphasizing 'THE FIRST TRIMESTER', featuring a celebratory cartoon that suggests a major life milestone. The presence of a female-presenting figure, balloons, and a domestic/bathroom scene subtly alludes to early pregnancy (e.g., morning sickness or big news moments), supporting the week-by-week theme.",
    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No major contrasts. The lighthearted, cartoon celebratory tone emphasizes the excitement of the \u2018first trimester\u2019 but may slightly gloss over challenges (e.g., morning sickness) suggested in the title. The visual focus is celebration rather than detailed instructional/medical content."
