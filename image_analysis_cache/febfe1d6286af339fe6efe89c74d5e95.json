    "Any contrasts or mismatches between thumbnail and title": "No significant mismatch; both focus clearly on the use of Lidocaine for pain conditions. However, the title references specific medical conditions (Vulvodynia, Pudendal Neuralgia), which are not visually indicated or illustrated in the thumbnail; the image relies on the ointment tube as the main referent."
